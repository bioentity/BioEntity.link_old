        "IN development, many cells migrate or extend processes to specific locations to make connections with the appropriate partner cells. For this to happen, cells must recognize their extracellular environment, and direct the outgrowth activity in the appropriate direction. One of the most striking examples of directed cell outgrowth occurs during the extension of a process from a neuronal cell. Neurons are typically polarized, and extend two different types of processes or neurites: an axon, which represents the output side of neuronal signals, and a larger number of dendrites, providing input. In the case of axons, a specialized structure, the growth cone, forms at the tips of neuronal extensions. The growth cone acts as a navigation center, integrating information from the extracellular environment, and executing changes in the direction of outgrowth by modulating the cytoskeleton. Growth cones can navigate considerable distances by traveling along specific pathways to find their target cell(s). To form a properly functional nervous system, neurons must make precise connections with synaptic partners, and form intricate networks. Defects in axonal navigation lead to the disruption of functional neuronal circuits, and serious neurological defects.",
        "The process of directed outgrowth of neurites can be divided into consecutive steps. First, the neuron has to initiate formation of a new process. Process identity as axon or dendrite has to be established. This is typically coupled to the overall polarization of the neuron. The axon or dendrite has to navigate toward the target, which usually requires a number of guidance decisions on the way. The navigation process is much more complex for axons, which frequently extend over large distances, whereas dendrites are often branched and cover a volume closer to the cell body. Neurite outgrowth stops in the target area, usually at well-defined positions. When neurites are branched, the position and number of branches has to be controlled. For dendrites, which cover a volume with a highly branched dendritic tree structure, a mechanism of self-avoidance ensures that dendritic branches are spaced optimally to cover the volume. Finally, synaptic partners have to be identified, and synapse formation has to be coordinated between pre and postsynaptic neurons. The best understood aspect of neurite outgrowth is the targeted navigation step. This review therefore focuses largely on pathways and cues that directly influence axon navigation, and will not exhaustively cover other aspects of axon outgrowth such as cell type specification or developmental timing.",

            "Most axons in",
            "navigate to their targets during embryonic or early larval stages, where the overall architecture of the nervous system is laid down. In addition to navigation-based outgrowth, axons elongate while maintaining circuit architecture while the animal grows fourfold in length during larval and early adult life. Little is known of mechanisms underlying this proportional growth of axons, in any organism. Collateral branching also occurs after axon growth; as this involves formation of growth cones from existing axons, it may be mechanistically relevant to regenerative axon growth. The architecture of the",
            "nervous system is complete by late larval stages and does not display overt changes or plasticity in early adult life, although several studies have characterized age-dependent sprouting (",
            ";",
            "). After their initial outgrowth, axons possess remarkable capacities to regenerate after injury. Regenerative axon regrowth can take many forms, among which a typical mechanism involves reformation of a growth-cone-like structure at the severed end of a damaged axon. This regenerative growth cone resembles developmental growth cones, but typically undergoes error-prone navigation to its original targets."

                    "). Mutations in these structural components lead to misassembled and/or broken basement membranes, resulting in severe defects in tissue organization, and embryonic or larval lethality.

This raises the possibility that certain laminin mutations might affect the localization of guidance cues, or the ability of cells to interact with basement membrane components. In laminin mutants, basement membrane structures are found surrounding individual misguided axons and mispositioned axon bundles (",
                    ";",
                    "). In mutants where axons are misguided, laminin localizes to the mispositioned axons rather than the normal pathways of the nerves. Further, laminin is associated with cell surfaces before the reported expression of other basement membrane components, and the laminin &#x03b1; subunits have unique expression patterns; in particular, LAM-3 is associated with the nerve ring, ventral nerve cord, and sublateral nerves (",
                    "). Together, this suggests that axons have specific laminin &#x03b1; receptors, and actively direct the assembly of an extracellular matrix."

                    "Tropic guidance cues are molecules that, through various assays, were found to provide directionality by acting as either attractants or repellents. Historically, genes involved in axon outgrowth were revealed through genetic screens for mutations that affect the ability of either circumferentially or longitudinally directed axons to reach their targets. In general, defects in dorso-ventral navigation along the body wall are somewhat easier to interpret. Defects in genes affecting anterior-posterior migration typically do not lead to a complete loss of axonal orientation, since axons in such mutants still broadly extend along the anterior-posterior axis, but are either in the wrong axon tract or deviate from a straight trajectory. Furthermore, the penetrance of defects in mutants affecting anterior-posterior navigation tends to be substantially lower compared to mutants affecting dorso-ventral navigation, which are highly penetrant in mutants in guidance cues such as UNC-6. One reason for this difference could be the fact that axons navigating along the dorso-ventral axis navigate in isolation,",
                    ", they are all pioneers and have to find their way independently. By contrast, the major longitudinal axon tracts contain a larger number of axons, so that at least later outgrowing axons have pre-existing axon tracts for additional orientation. In addition, the guidance system along the anterior&#x2013;posterior (a&#x2013;p) axis could",

Since muscle cells in the embryo have established tight attachments and connections through the basement membrane to the epidermal cells, muscle quadrants likely form physical barriers that restrict the possibility of axons to stray too much from a longitudinal trajectory. In fact, navigation defects within the VNC, which is flanked by two muscle quadrants, typically involve axons switching back and forth between left and right axon tracts (midline crossing), but rarely if ever leaving the VNC itself. Live imaging of motor commissure outgrowth in larvae (",
                    ") shows that growth cones stall and pause when they encounter dorsal muscle cells, indicating that the muscle cells indeed form a physical barrier for growth cones."

Taken together, while Wnts play an important role in cell migration along the a&#x2013;p axis, they do not appear to act as major tropic guidance cue for neuronal processes. This is in contrast to the major tropic guidance cue for migration along the d&#x2013;v axis (UNC-6), which is equally important for cell and axon migration. Wnt mutants show defects mainly in initiation and termination of process outgrowth in a small number of neurons. Axon navigation defects are sometimes found in addition to process outgrowth defects, but limited to an even smaller number of neurons. The role of Wnts in axonal navigation in",

In most cases, IgCAMs seem to act as receptors rather than adhesion molecules, but ligands or binding partners for many IgCAM are currently unknown. For defects in the ventral nerve cord, it is difficult to determine whether the primary defect is an adhesion defect leading to defasciculation of axons, or a failure to respond to a guidance cue(s). In both cases, the consequence is likely that axons in the VNC would cross the midline to extend in the contralateral axon tract. Therefore, based on this phenotype alone, it is not clear whether a missing IgCAM acts as an adhesion molecule or as a receptor.",

In order to produce movement, this remodeling needs to alter the cell&#x2019;s structural scaffold, the cell&#x2019;s adhesive properties, and it needs to assemble the machinery that produces force. The cytoskeleton is integrally involved in each event, and regulating the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments is intricate, involving the integration of signals from multiple pathways (",

                "). This is described as a repulsive or attractive response, respectively. The function of a guidance cue is often classified as repulsive or attractive depending on whether loss of function prevents an axon from extending away from or toward the source of the cue. Some cues clearly play a dominant role in guiding outgrowth toward or away from the source of that cue. For example, different neurons extend outgrowth either toward or away from ventral sources of UNC-6. Conceivably the UNC-6 cue strongly influences the actin superstructure along the surface of these neurons; whether a repulsive or attractive response is elicited by the cue depends on the repertoire of proteins expressed by the neuron."

Indeed, there are several cases where extracellular matrix molecules, and their receptors, act with guidance cues to direct migrations. These include basement membrane components such as UNC-52 (perlecan), NID-1 (nidogen), and CLE-1 (type XVIII collagen); and receptors such as DDR-1 and DDR-2 (discoidin domain receptors), DGN-1 (dystroglycan), and UNC-71 (ADAM) (",

Once the self-organizing polarization is initialized, the role of UNC-6 is to increase the probability of UNC-40 asymmetric localization at the site of interaction. However, the site of asymmetric localization does not require the UNC-6 ligand; UNC-40 will localize stochastically at different sites if the self-organizing polarization is triggered and there is no UNC-6. Since UNC-40 signaling at the surface orients the outgrowth activity, the direction of UNC-40-mediated outgrowth activity is also determined stochastically. In the simplest case, the UNC-6 cue could set a very high probability of outgrowth activity at the side of the neuron toward the source of UNC-6, and the outgrowth activity will be oriented relative to the source. In this case, the system behaves as predicted by an attraction-repulsion model. However, with the self-organizing model there is always a probability associated with outgrowth in every other direction, so that if the probability of outgrowth is low at the surface toward the source, then the probability of outgrowth activity in other directions will be high. Therefore, if one cue increases or decreases the probability of outgrowth in one direction, it must affect the probability of outgrowth in other direction(s) as well. Because there are different cues acting on a neuron",

For example, if the probability of outgrowth in the anterior direction is 0.4, in the posterior direction is 0.4, and in the ventral direction is 0.2, then the direction of movement over time will be in the ventral direction. This predicts that a cue that has a strong effect on outgrowth, at either the anterior or posterior surface, will not direct outgrowth along the a&#x2013;p axis; instead, outgrowth will be directed by the weaker effect of the cue at the ventral surface. Movement will fluctuate back and forth in the anterior and posterior directions, but will consistently move ahead in the ventral direction.

                "). In general, triggering UNC-40 self-organizing polarity allows external factors to determine the probability of UNC-40 asymmetrically localizing at a surface of the cell. The outcome of this process is to tightly localize UNC-40 signaling to specific locations, which, in turn, could dramatically increase the effect of UNC-40-mediated signaling activity. Besides outgrowth, in neurons UNC-40-mediated signaling plays an important role in orienting synapse assembly, axon arborization, and extrasynaptic neurosecretory terminals (",
                ";",
                ";",
                ";",

                ";",
                ";",
                "). Like outgrowth, these events require an activity to be asymmetrically oriented in response to local environmental cues. Consistent with these different events being linked, several proteins are known to affect multiple events. For example, the intracellular protein, SYD-1, regulates synaptogenesis and the active transport of organelles to the synaptic region of axons (",
                ";",
                ";",
                ";",
                ",",
                "). SYD-1 also plays a role in UNC-40-mediated axon guidance (",
                "). Another example is CLEC-38&#x2014;a transmembrane protein that negatively regulates UNC-40-mediated axon outgrowth and is required for synaptic assembly (",
                "). The precise molecular mechanisms through which different proteins orient UNC-40 activity remain to be determined. However, due to the UNC-40 self-organizing polarization mechanism, a protein might influence seemingly diverse developmental events, such as axon guidance and synaptogenesis, because its activity can alter the probability of UNC-40 asymmetrically localizing at a particular surface. Depending on the state of the cell, UNC-40 localization may influence the localization of components required for axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis, etc."

Here, the neuron only responds to the attractant ligand and the receptor mediates outgrowth activity that is directed toward the source of the attractant. In the self-organizing polarization model, a signal triggers feedback loops that asymmetrically localizes receptor signaling. The response to the cues increases or decreases the probability of where the receptor will mediate outgrowth activity. (B) Because the direction of outgrowth stochastically fluctuates at any instant of time, the movement of outgrowth can be considered as a succession of random steps. Depicted here are different objects (any mass) on a line, and 50 random walks of 50 steps from each point according to the probability distribution below. A probability distribution for the location of the object after the walk is given by the endpoints of the lines. The displacement of an object varies according to the degree of fluctuation. Because the outgrowth activity along the surface of an axon fluctuates, the moments of the membrane (a unit of mass) would move according to the same properties. (C) To illustrate how cues control the direction of outgrowth according to each model, an axon is depicted that approaches and crosses over an intermediate target, which expresses two different cues. In the attraction-repulsion model, the axon must switch its response from attraction to repulsion. In the self-organizing polarization model, the cues continue to promote outgrowth activity, but there is a change in the degree to which the direction of outgrowth fluctuates. The random walk models illustrate that the direction of outgrowth does not change, although the displacement does."

Some attempts have been made to uncover a molecular basis for the differences (",

The difference in this case might be due to the larger number of axons in the right tract, which can provide additional (adhesive) cues for axons extending along the VNC. Differential use of guidance cues of axons extending in the same axon bundle also comes from the observation that the penetrance of defects in the absence of the pioneer (AVG) is very different in different classes of follower neurons, suggesting that certain classes of neurons depend more on cues from the pioneer than others (",

Most seem to have little to no role in developmental axon outgrowth; some may be involved in injury sensing. Regenerative axon growth may also be generally more sensitive to mutant backgrounds than development. Overall, these screens have greatly expanded the genetic landscape of axon regeneration, setting the stage for mechanistic studies currently underway. Axon regeneration is highly multifactorial, and no single manipulation is sufficient to restore perfect regeneration. Nevertheless, certain pathways and signals have emerged as playing major roles, and an outline of the events and pathways active in the minutes and hours after injury is emerging (",
