<body>
<p>ACCURATE duplication of chromosomes is critical for the preservation of genetic information and cell survival. Yet, replication fork progression can be hindered not only by a number of natural physical obstacles in the genome, limiting nucleotides or proteins required for DNA synthesis, but also by spontaneous or induced DNA lesions that escaped repair, resulting in replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeman and Cimprich 2013</xref>). DNA damage leading to replication fork arrest and single-strand gap formation opposite the lesion can be temporarily bypassed by several mechanisms referred to as DNA-damage-tolerance (DDT) pathways, dependent on the Rad6-Rad18 complex, and also by Rad51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) when the former fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehner and Jinks-Robertson 2014</xref>) (Supplemental Material, Figure S1 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). DDT can be divided into the error-prone mode which involves the recruitment of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases that are able to directly replicate across the lesion, often at the cost of fidelity; and the error-free mode which is depe<!-- Q7 -->ndent on Rad5, where template switching occurs, and allows the use of an undamaged chromatid as a template for lesion bypass, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sale (2012)</xref><!-- DBComment7 -->. The exact mechanism of template switching is unknown, but it has been suggested that it also requires Rad51-dependent HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branzei <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanoli <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Minca and Kowalski 2011</xref>). This demonstrates the importance of both DDT- and HR-mediated pathways in coping with various forms of replication stress, although their relative contributions and interactions have not been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unk <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sale 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Symington <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>DDT pathways are regulated by post-translational modifications of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) which forms a homotrimeric ring around DNA and serves as a binding platform for DNA polymerases and other replication-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moldovan <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) (Figure S1 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). Formation of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) gaps coated by replication protein A at the stalled replication fork recruits the Rad6-Rad18 E2-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that promotes monoubiquitination of PCNA at highly conserved Lys164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoege <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davies <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). This modification creates a binding site for TLS polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bienko <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). The error-free mode of DDT is activated when the monoubiquitinated PCNA is further polyubiquitinated by the E2 heterodimer Ubc13-Mms2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rad5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hofmann and Pickart 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ulrich and Jentsch 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoege <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Additionally, during unperturbed replication, the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) (Smt3 in yeast) is attached to PCNA predominantly at Lys164 by SUMO ligase Siz1, and also at Lys127 by Siz1 and Siz2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoege <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parker <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). It was reported that PCNA SUMOylation mediates the recruitment of the Srs2 helicase to the replication fork, leading to prevention of a subset of HR repair. This HR inhibition by Srs2 is toxic in <italic>rad18</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), confirming the role of both HR and DDT in the replication stress response. On the other hand, Srs2-PCNA interaction was also demonstrated to limit the length of DNA repair synthesis and thus favor the HR synthesis-dependent strand annealing pathway (SDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkovics <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miura <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Importantly, Srs2 was also shown to have the ability to dismantle Rad51 nucleofilaments and to inhibit Rad51-dri<!-- Q8 -->ven DNA strand exchange (Krejci <italic>et al.</italic> 2003; Veaute <italic>et al.</italic> 2003)<!-- DBComment8 -->. The Srs2 helicase itself can undergo SUMOylation, which disfavors its binding to SUMO-PCNA but is important for its interaction with Rad51 and other recombination factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2016</xref>). Therefore, modulation of the equilibrium between unmodified and modified forms of Srs2 plays a role in the choice of pathway used to deal with replication stress.</p>
<p>Perturbations in replication fork progression can lead to fork collapse and double-strand break (DSB) formation. Srs2 promotes their repair by SDSA, yielding noncrossing over (non-CO) products and thus limiting loss of heterozygosity events in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ira <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niu and Klein 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, D-loops formed after Rad51 recombinase-dependent strand invasion might be stabilized and extended until a second end of a DNA break is captured. Most resulting joint molecules are single or double Holliday junctions (HJs). Double HJs are dissolved by the complex consisting of the Sgs1 helicase, the DNA topoisomerase Top3, and the stimulatory protein Rmi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gangloff <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mullen <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cejka <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) resulting in non-CO recombination products. Recombination intermediates that escaped dissolution by the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex in S phase or were converted into single HJs are resolved by the Mus81-Mms4 endonuclease in G<sub>2</sub>/M leading exclusively to CO products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matos <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szakal and Branzei 2013</xref>). Any remaining joint molecules are removed by the Yen1 endonuclease during anaphase to complete the repair and disconnect the sister chromatids before chromosome segregation in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanco <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), yielding both CO and non-CO products (Figure S1 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). Single HJ can also be processed by Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitchel <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), demonstrating that Srs2 and Sgs1 can jointly regulate non-CO formation either by promoting the SDSA pathway or by processing HJ-type intermediates. The significance of these alternative pathways preventing the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates, which arise during replication stress, is manifested by synthetic lethality of <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; double mutations that can be rescued by deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mullen <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>ULS1</italic> (<italic>DIS1</italic>/<italic>RIS1</italic>), due to the presence of the C-terminal Swi2/Snf2-related DNA translocase domain, was implied to play a role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. Uls1 also possesses four SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) in its N-terminal part and a C-terminal RING domain, a signature structure for ubiquitin ligases. Uls1 interacts with SUMO and Ubc4, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, while <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; cells accumulate high-molecular-weight SUMO conjugates, which led to its classification as a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uzunova <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Consequently, Uls1<!-- Q9 --> was proposed to function in nonhomologous end joining inhibition by dislodging poly-SUMOylated Rap1 molecules from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lescasse <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>)<!-- DBComment9 -->. However, enzymatic activity of Uls1 has never been biochemically demonstrated and little is known about its targets.</p>
<p>We have shown that Uls1 is involved in the replication stress response and its presence is detrimental in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cal-B&#x0105;kowska <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Importantly, roles of Uls1 in DNA metabolism require an ATP-dependent translocase activity, RING domain, and SIMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cal-B&#x0105;kowska <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lescasse <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). It can therefore be hypothesized that Uls1 may regulate DNA-repair-pathway choice at the sites of replication-associated DNA damage by modifying SUMOylation status and thus the abundance and/or activities of its target proteins.</p>
<p>Here we identify deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> as a suppressor of <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; synthetic lethality and suggest that Uls1 assists in a Rad51-dependent pathway detrimental in this mutant. We also demonstrate that Uls1 downregulates the level of Srs2 SUMOylation, favoring Srs2 interaction with PCNA, and thus promoting the PCNA-Srs2-dependent DNA damage tolerance pathway. We propose that this activity might contribute to Uls1 toxicity in mutants devoid of the Sgs1 helicase.</p>

Then, beads were washed three times with an adequate lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted with 20 &#x03BC;l of 2&#x00D7; Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 65&#x00B0;. The eluted proteins were resolved on Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel 4&#x2013;15% (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After Ponceau S staining, the membrane was cut into fragments corresponding to the size of analyzed proteins. Each fragment was then immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibody (anti-PCNA, anti-Srs2, or anti-HA).</p>

<title>Uls1 presence contributes to the severe synthetic growth defect of the double mutant devoid of Mus81 endonuclease and Sgs1 helicase</title>
<p>We have previously shown that Uls1 has a role in dealing with perturbations in DNA replication that is independent of both Mus81 and Yen1 endonucleases, and that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> attenuates the replication stress-related defects of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant in a Rad51 recombinase and Rad18-, Rad5-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>It was thus interesting to examine the effect of <italic>ULS1</italic> deletion on the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant. We found upon sporulation of the heterozygous diploid that most spores of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; genotype were viable, although slow growing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm that the observed rescue of a <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; doubl<!-- Q11 -->e mutant with a severe synthetic growth defect was indeed due to the depletion of Uls1 protein, we constructed a heterozygous diploid containing <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; as well as the <italic>HA-ULS1</italic> gene under the control of a <italic>GALS</italic> promoter inserted in the endogenous <italic>ULS1</italic> locus<!-- DBComment11 -->. We demonstrated that adding an HA tag does not change Uls1 activity, since the presence of HA-Uls1 rescued the increased genotoxin sensitivity of the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>GALS-HA-ULS1</italic> mutant (Figure S2 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). In addition, overproduction of HA-Uls1 from either <italic>GALS</italic> or the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter was toxic in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant (Figure S2 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>) as described before for untagged Uls1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cal-B&#x0105;kowska <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). We then analyzed several <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>GALS-HA-ULS1</italic> clones on YP medium containing glucose or galactose as a carbon source when the expression of <italic>ULS1</italic> gene was repressed or induced, respectively. We found that the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>GALS-HA-ULS1</italic> mutant cultured on glucose increased its cell numbers nearly eightfold during 24 hr, while shifting the cells to galactose resulted in a decrease in the viable cell numbers to about one fourth of the initial cell count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This corresponded with the maximum of appearance of the HA-Uls1 protein after 12 hr induction, as indicated by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Srs2 as a target of Uls1 activity</title>
<p>The <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant&#x2019;s synthetic sickness is also rescued by deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), but here we show that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> did not lead to the rescue of the synthetic lethality of a <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0394; double mutant (Figure S3 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). This raises the possibility that the Srs2-dependent pathway might play a role in the alleviation of the replication stress-related defects in <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; cells by deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic>.</p>
<p>Srs2 protein is known to be SUMOylated in a manner largely dependent on the presence of its SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Uls1, as a proposed SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uzunova <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lescasse <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), could affect this post-translational modification and thus influence Srs2 activity.</p>
<p>To investigate this possibility, we transformed wild type, <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394;, and a strain overexpressing <italic>ULS1</italic> from a constitutive <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter with plasmids harboring genes for <italic>SRS2</italic> or <italic>srs2-R1</italic>, devoid of a SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Breton <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le&#x00F3;n Ortiz <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), under the control of a copper-induced <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter. We found that in the protein extract from the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; strain overexpressing the <italic>SRS2</italic> gene, Srs2 protein migrated as a more profuse band of heavier molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and Figure S4A in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). This was not seen for the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; strain overexpressing the <italic>srs2-R1</italic> allele, or for wild type overexpressing <italic>SRS2</italic> or <italic>srs2-R1</italic>, suggesting that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> might lead to the accumulation of heavy molecular, possibly SUMOylated, forms of Srs2. Moreover, in strains overexpressing <italic>ULS1</italic>, the level of both Srs2 and Srs2-R1 was reduced approximately by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and Figure S4A in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). To confirm that the accumulating heavy molecular forms of Srs2 were indeed SUMOylated, we immunoprecipitated proteins from extracts from the transformants described above, using the anti-Srs2 antibody, and analyzed the immunoprecipitates by Western blot with anti-SUMO and anti-Srs2 antibodies. Indeed, deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> resulted in the accumulation of SUMOylated forms of Srs2 protein, while overproduction of Uls1 led to a decrease in the amount of Srs2-SUMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> compare lane 2 with 4 and 6, and Figure S4B in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>). The Srs2 SIM has earlier been demonstrated to be required not only for its binding to PCNA, but also for its SUMOylation under unperturbed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Breton <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Consistently, we observed virtually no Srs2-SUMO conjugates in immunoprecipitates from transformants containing Srs2-R1 protein, devoid of SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> compare lane 2 with 8, 10, 12; and Figure S4B in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.196568/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Srs2 has been shown to interact with Slx5, a second STUbL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urulangodi <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), so we compared the level of Srs2-SUMO in <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutants overexpressing <italic>SRS2</italic>.

We probed Srs2 immunoprecipitates from these strains with anti-SUMO antibody and confirmed that these species corresponded to Srs2-SUMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

<p>The analysis of protein stability by CHX chase revealed that Slx5-Slx8 STUbL is involved in the regulation of endogenous Srs2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urulangodi <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Since we found, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, that in strains overexpressing <italic>ULS1</italic> the level of Srs2 is reduced, we also examined the stability of the endogenous Srs2 protein by CHX chase in wild type and <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; and compared it to the <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; mutant. We found that in both mutants the Srs2 protein level was stabilized, while it dropped by about half in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>); confirming that Uls1 also mediates Srs2 turnover, similarly to Slx5-Slx8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urulangodi <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). However, <italic>SLX5</italic> and <italic>SLX8</italic> have been shown to have negative interactions with <italic>ULS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and we also demonstrated that the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; mutant has a stronger growth defect and is more sensitive to HU and MMS than the single <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan <italic>et al.</italic> (2013</xref>) described an antagonistic relationship between <italic>ULS1</italic> and <italic>SLX5</italic>. Moreover, while deletion of <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; alleviates <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; sensitivity to MMS and HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cal-B&#x0105;kowska <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), the <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mullen <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). This suggests that Uls1 and Slx5 also have separate functions in the cell.</p>
<p>We were unable to detect a signal from Uls1 on Western blot when it was expressed from its native promoter, so to examine the Uls1-Srs2 interaction we used the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0394; strain overexpressing <italic>HA-ULS1</italic> and either wild-type <italic>SRS2</italic> or <italic>srs2-R1</italic>. We demonstrated by IP that Uls1 was able to bind to Srs2 even in the absence of SIM in Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we mapped the Srs2-Uls1 interaction site to the N-terminal fragment of Uls1 and C-terminal part of Srs2 and showed that it was independent of the Srs2 SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) in accordance with the IP data. This finding is consistent with Uls1&#x2019;s ability to regulate Srs2 protein levels independently of Srs2&#x2019;s SUMOylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and reports in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xie <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abed <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) showing that STUbLs can also bind to their substrates through SUMO-independent interactions. The fact that Uls1 can bind Srs2 in the absence of the Srs2 SIM might indicate that the Uls1-Srs2 interaction is independent from Srs2-PCNA binding and also from Srs2 SUMOylation.</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> compromises Srs2-PCNA interaction</title>
<p>Previous work has demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>SRS2</italic> has a negative effect on growth in wild type and even more so in many mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mankouri <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le&#x00F3;n Ortiz <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). It has also been shown that an increased abundance of the helicase dead mutant form of Srs2 is more toxic than the wild-type protein, while overproduction of mutant forms unable to interact with PCNA, such as Srs2-R1, is not toxic in wild type and the vast majority of tested mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le&#x00F3;n Ortiz <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Using strains with <italic>HA-SRS2</italic> and <italic>HA-srs2-R1</italic> genes expressed from a methionine-repressible promoter introduced into an <italic>SRS2</italic>-endogenous locus, we examined the effect of <italic>ULS1</italic> deletion on Srs2 overproduction toxicity. We found that when <italic>HA-SRS2</italic> is overexpressed, the wild-type cells were much more sensitive to HU and MMS than <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutant cells. Overexpression of <italic>HA-srs2-R1</italic>, however, was less toxic and conferred the similar degree of HU and MMS sensitivity in both wild type and the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since it has been shown that SUMOylation decreases the ability of Srs2 to bind PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), we propose that lower toxicity of <italic>SRS2</italic> overexpression in the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutant results from accumulation of SUMOylated forms of Srs2 in this mutant background, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. This would compromise Srs2 binding to PCNA and reduce the toxicity of <italic>SRS2</italic> overexpression. These data suggest a physiological function for Uls1 in regulating Srs2 binding to PCNA through modification of Srs2&#x2019;s SUMOylation status.</p>

(C) The N-terminal part (2&#x2013;878) of Uls1 (pGADT7-Uls1_N plasmid) interacts with PCNA (Pol30, #618 plasmid) and PCNA K127/164R (Pol30RR, #1040 plasmid) as shown by yeast two-hybrid assay (in AH109 strain).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gen.196568fig5"></graphic></fig>
<p>We thus assayed the influence of Uls1 on Srs2 interaction with PCNA more directly. Interestingly, we found that Uls1 itself immunoprecipitated with PCNA and this interaction was independent of the presence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, galactose). Using the yeast two-hybrid system we mapped the PCNA-Uls1 interaction site to the N-terminal fragment of Uls1 and showed that Uls1 SIMs were not critical for Uls1 binding to PCNA (Pol30). We also demonstrated that the Uls1-PCNA interaction did not require PCNA SUMOylation, as the Pol30RR, lacking SUMOylation sites, and wild-type Pol30 were indistinguishable in our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Under standard growth conditions without genotoxin treatment, we could immunoprecipitate Srs2 with PCNA both in the wild-type strain and in the <italic>GALS-HA-ULS1</italic> strain grown on galactose, but we were unable to immunoprecipitate Srs2 with PCNA in the <italic>GALS-HA-ULS1</italic> strain grown on glucose when expression of <italic>ULS1</italic> was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, glucose). These results show that in the absence of Uls1, binding of Srs2 to PCNA is compromised. It is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Breton <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) that Srs2 SUMOylation negatively affects its PCNA binding and, since we show that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> leads to the accumulation of Srs2-SUMO, it follows that the Srs2-PCNA interaction would be attenuated in this mutant. Overall our results suggest that Uls1 can regulate Srs2&#x2019;s ability to bind PCNA by modifying Srs2&#x2019;s SUMOylation status.</p>

<p>Attenuation of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant phenotype by deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> requires the presence of Rad51 and Rad5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cal-B&#x0105;kowska <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), so we examined the effect of <italic>RAD5</italic> deletion in a <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; background. We found that deletion of <italic>RAD5</italic> slightly rescued the severe synthetic growth defect of the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant, suggesting that some aspect of Rad5 activity may be detrimental in cells lacking Sgs1 and Mus81. Interestingly, deletion of <italic>RAD5</italic> reversed the beneficial effect of both <italic>RAD51</italic> as well as <italic>ULS1</italic> deletion on the phenotype of the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These results suggest that a functional Rad5-dependent subpathway is required for the observed rescue of synthetic lethality of the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant in the <italic>rad51</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutant backgrounds.</p>
<p>Since the presence of <italic>ULS1</italic> is toxic in the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant background, similarly to that of <italic>RAD51</italic>, we could hypothesize that the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutation results in a partial inactivation of the Rad51-dependent pathway. To corroborate this assumption, we examined the interaction of <italic>uls1</italic> with other mutants in two systems that are established as being indicative of attenuation of HR pathways. First, it has been shown that deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> rescues <italic>rad18</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>rad5</italic>&#x0394; mutants&#x2019; slow growth as well as their UV and MMS sensitivity, in a manner dependent on the presence of Rad51, suggesting a requirement for HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedl <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). If Uls1 is involved in HR, its depletion should not lead to the rescue of <italic>rad18</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>rad5</italic>&#x0394; mutants&#x2019; phenotypes. In accordance with that assumption, we demonstrated that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> had no effect on <italic>rad18</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>rad5</italic>&#x0394; mutant phenotypes and even slightly reversed the rescue observed in the <italic>rad18</italic>&#x0394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>rad5</italic>&#x0394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0394; mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), as has been demonstrated before for Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). This implies that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> partially impairs the Rad51-mediated HR pathway, making the cells more reliant on the Rad18-Rad5-dependent one. Second, cells lacking a structure-selective flap endonuclease, Rad27, depend on HR for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Symington 1998</xref>). We found that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> in the <italic>rad27</italic>&#x0394; background led to severe growth defect of double mutants, which is consistent with the role of Uls1 in the process of HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>We thus propose that Uls1 contributes to the pathway where intermediates generated at replication forks by Rad51 (and Rad5) are dismantled by Srs2 bound to SUMO-PCNA. Upon <italic>ULS1</italic> deletion, accumulating Srs2-SUMO, unable to bind PCNA, takes part in an alternative recombination repair pathway(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) involving other recombination factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) and possibly also Rad5.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> suppresses the severe growth defect of the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant similarly to deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic>, suggesting that Uls1 may be involved in the same pathway as Rad51, leading to the accumulation of recombination intermediates that are toxic in cells devoid of both Sgs1 and Mus81. We also demonstrate that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> does not lead to the rescue of the synthetic lethality of a <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x0394; double mutant. Therefore we hypothesized that the Srs2-dependent pathway might play a role in the suppression of the replication stress-related defects in <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; cells by deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic>.</p>
<p>Consequently, we found that in the absence of Uls1, Srs2-SUMO conjugates accumulate and the protein is stabilized, as is also observed in the <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urulangodi <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Uls1 can bind to both Srs2 and PCNA, but interestingly, we were unable to immunoprecipitate Srs2 with PCNA in the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutant, suggesting that in this mutant Srs2-PCNA interaction was attenuated. This is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Breton <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) that Srs2-SUMO is compromised in binding to PCNA. This result suggests that Uls1, by limiting the pool of SUMOylated Srs2, may promote the Srs2-PCNA interaction.</p>
<p>It has been shown before that the ability of Srs2 to bind PCNA is responsible for the toxicity of Srs2 overproduction in most mutant backgrounds, and that overexpression of <italic>srs2-R1</italic> (unable to bind PCNA and not SUMOylated) is not detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le&#x00F3;n Ortiz <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Consistently with our biochemical findings, we demonstrate that deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> reduces the toxicity of <italic>SRS2</italic> overexpression in wild type. This result supports our conjecture that the form of Srs2 abundant in the absence of Uls1 is indeed defective in PCNA binding. We thus propose Srs2 to be a physiological target for Uls1.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data imply that during the replication stress response, Uls1 influences Srs2- and Sgs1-dependent pathways. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells grown under unperturbed conditions, replication forks can encounter various obstacles, leading to fork stalling, collapse, or even DSB formation. In response to such mild replication stress, Rad51- and Rad5-dependent, error-free postreplication pathways like SDSA and the PCNA polyubiquitination-dependent template switch are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branzei <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkovics <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miura <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Additionally, PCNA-SUMO mediates the recruitment of the Srs2 helicase to the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In this way, recombination at the replication fork is downregulated. Genetic data from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suggest that Sgs1 is involved in promoting SDSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitchel <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), although its exact activity is uncertain. Sgs1 has also been implicated in a dissolution of Rad5-mediated template switch intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branzei <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and reversion of regressed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lo <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). We demonstrate that Uls1 promotes Srs2 binding to PCNA, presumably by decreasing the amount of Srs2-SUMO at replication forks. So we propose a model in which Uls1 acts by channeling Rad51- and Rad5-generated intermediates into the PCNA-Srs2-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We infer that this is the source of Uls1 toxicity in <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; as well as in the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant.</p>
<p>In the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutant, the Srs2-SUMO acc<!-- Q12 -->umulates and is unable to bind PCNA<!-- DBComment12 -->. We have shown that both <italic>HA-srs2-R1</italic> (not SUMOylated and unable to bind PCNA) and <italic>srs2-3KR</italic> (not SUMOylated but is able to bind PCNA) reverse the rescue of MMS and HU sensitivity conferred by <italic>ULS1</italic> deletion in the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant. This suggests that not only decreased PCNA binding but also the activity of SUMOylated Srs2 contribute to the suppression of the phenotypes of <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; and possibly also of <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutants. These results support a conclusion, also suggested in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saponaro <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolesar <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), that SUMOylated Srs2 is active in PCNA-independent recombination repair pathways, and not only targeted for degradation. We propose that in <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutants Srs2 activity is redirected toward these alternative pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Rad5 has also been shown to mediate postreplication repair by replication fork reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minca and Kowalski 2010</xref>) and D-loop invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkovics <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) independently of Rad51 and perhaps also of PCNA. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the Rad5-dependent pathway is required for the rescue of the <italic>mus81</italic>&#x0394; <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant&#x2019;s severe growth defect by deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic> or <italic>ULS1</italic>. Rad5, together with Srs2-SUMO, is also required for the rescue of the <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x0394; mutant&#x2019;s HU and MMS sensitivity by deletion of <italic>ULS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), so we propose that Rad5 could participate in the alternative pathway activated in the <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; mutant when SUMOylated Srs2 accumulates.</p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that during unperturbed replication and at very low levels of DNA damage, Rad18-dependent DDT is the pathway of choice, with the error-free Rad5- (and Rad51-) dependent template switch operating during S phase, and error-prone synthesis active mainly on ssDNA gaps in G<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hishida <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehner and Jinks-Robertson 2014</xref>). We postulate that this error-free pathway is stimulated by Uls1. It is known, however, that SUMO conjugation of PCNA is not triggered exclusively in S phase, but also during severe DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoege <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), so under such conditions a switch to another pathway of DDT most probably occurs. One candidate pathway has recently been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urulangodi <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) where Elg1, Esc2, and the Slx5-Slx8 complex collaborate to limit the Srs2 antirecombinase activity at the sites of replication-associated damage. Interestingly, Uls1 and Slx5 have been shown to interact physically with Elg1, but the phenotypes of <italic>elg1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>elg1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; double mutants are different and the <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394; mutant is sensitive to MMS, while <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cal-B&#x0105;kowska <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parnas <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Interaction with Slx5 has been proposed to be important for Uls1 activity, but the relationship between the two proteins was antagonistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). This suggests that Uls1 and Slx5 are not redundant, and have unique functions in the cell. We could speculate that the former may operate during low and the latter at high levels of replication stress. This would be consistent with the lack of DNA-damage sensitivity in <italic>uls1</italic>&#x0394; as opposed to the high sensitivity of <italic>slx5</italic>&#x0394;, and the synthetic sickness observed in a double mutant devoid of both Uls1 and Slx5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The evidence is mounting that Uls1 may play an important role in DNA metabolism by targeting different SUMO-modified proteins. It would thus be very interesting in the future to determine the identity of other Uls1 partners and elucidate the nature of the interplay between Uls1- and Slx5-regulated pathways.</p>
