<abstract>
<p>Our understanding of the cellular mechanisms by which animals regulate their response to starvation is limited, despite the strong relevance of the problem to major human health issues. The L1 diapause of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, where first-stage larvae arrest in response to a food-less environment, is an excellent system to study this mechanism. We found, through genetic manipulation and lipid analysis, that biosynthesis of ceramide, particularly those with longer fatty acid side chains, critically impacts animal survival during L1 diapause. Genetic interaction analysis<!-- Q1 --><!-- Q2 --><!-- Q3 --><!-- Q4 --><!-- Q5 --> suggests that ceramide may act in both insulin-IGF-1 signaling (IIS)-dependent and IIS-independent pathways to affect starvation survival<!-- DBComment1 --> <!-- DBComment2 --> <!-- DBComment3 --> <!-- DBComment4 --> <!-- DBComment5 -->. Genetic and expression analyses indicate <!-- Q6 -->that ceramide is required for maintaining the proper expression of previously characterized starvation-responsive genes, genes that are regulated by the IIS pathway and tumor suppressor Rb, and genes responsive to pathogen<!-- DBComment6 -->. These findings provide an important insight into the roles of sphingolipid metabolism, not only in starvation response, but also in aging and food-response-related human health problems.</p>

<body>
<p>DURING evolution, organisms have developed complex mechanisms to adapt to food-deprived <!-- Q7 -->environments<!-- DBComment7 -->. Individual cells respond to starvation by modulating intracellular signaling to maintain basal cellular activities and survive long periods of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caro-Maldonado and Munoz-Pinedo 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hardie 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonker <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). The study of an animal&#x2019;s response to starvation-induced stress is highly relevant to human health and medicine. For example, the study of signaling pathways and downstream events involved in the starvation response has had a major impact on the research of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finch and Ruvkun 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kenyon 2010</xref>) and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoehn <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wells and Siervo 2011</xref>). Understanding the regulation of the starvation response is also closely related to our treatment of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levine and Puzio-Kuter 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> presents a powerful model system for genetic and genomic analysis of the starvation response in animals. <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to food deprivation by altering reproductive developmental growth at various larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fielenbach and Antebi 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baugh 2013</xref>). When first larval stage (L1) animals encounter a food-free environment, they arrest development and reproductive growth (L1 diapause), and survive in this state for over 3&#x00A0;weeks. When nutrients are reintroduced, animals are capable of exiting the diapause and resuming larval development. Gene expression changes defined as the &#x201C;starvation-induced transcriptome,&#x201D; and &#x201C;refeeding induced transcriptome,&#x201D; have been systematically characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baugh <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The roles of the insulin-IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and AMPK pathways in starvation are conserved among organisms ranging from yeast, worms, and flies, to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baugh and Sternberg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narbonne and Roy 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hardie 2011</xref>). A transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channel and microRNAs were shown to modulate L1 diapause by regulating the IIS-dependent or -independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Ashrafi 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2011b</xref>). The interneurons AIY and AIB provide systemic control of the starvation response during L1 arrest partly through amino acid sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang and Avery 2009</xref>). We previously reported that tumor suppressor Rb critically impacts survival during L1 diapause by promoting the starvation-induced transcriptome, and repressing the refeeding induced transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), which affect the activity of multiple regulatory pathways. Identifying and analyzing new factors involved in the process continues to be important for us to understand how different signals and regulatory pathways coordinately promote long-term survival of animals in response to starvation. In particular, the roles of lipid metabolites in the process have not been well characterized.</p>
<p>Ceramide has been studied for its role in apoptosis and the response to certain stresses such as anoxia, cytokines, toxins, and chemotherapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannun and Obeid 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menuz <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nikolova-Karakashian and Rozenova 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mosbech <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cutler <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Most of these studies were carried out in nutrient-rich conditions, while the roles of ceramide under fasting conditions in whole organisms remain to be investigated. In this study, we investigate the roles of ceramide biosynthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> survival during starvation-induced L1 diapause.</p>

The total number of genes represents the overlap genes from the original data sets that the two sets of genes were generated from. The test gave rise to a representation factor (rf) and the probability (<italic>p</italic>) of finding an overlap of x genes. The representation factor is the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent groups. A representation factor &#x003E;1 indicates more overlap than expected of two independent groups, and a representation factor &#x003C;1 indicates less overlap than expected. Expected overlap was determined by multiplying the number of genes dysregulated in data set&#x00A0;1 by the number dysregulated in data set&#x00A0;2, and then dividing by the total number of genes that were detectable (for microarray datasets) and present in both datasets.</p>

<title>Reducing ceramide synthesis severely impairs animals&#x2019; ability to survive L1 starvation</title>
<p>To understand the role of ceramide in regulating animal starvation survival, we screened all available, viable, <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants in the ceramide metabolism pathways for altered L1 starvation survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS1.xls">Table S1</ext-link>), and found many such mutants were significantly short-lived during L1 starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, A&#x2013;C</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/FigureS1.pptx">Figure S1</ext-link>, A&#x2013;C, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS1.xls">Table S1</ext-link>).

<title>Tissue-specific expression suggests a nonautonomous role of the ceramide synthase</title>
<p>HYL-1 is expressed in the pharynx, intestine, and nervous system, while LAGR-1 is expressed in larval and adult pharyngeal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunt-Newbury <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The full-length <italic>hyl-1</italic> genomic DNA restored L1 starvation survival of the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, C and D</xref>). We next examined whether ceramide synthases act mainly in a particular tissue for the L1 starvation survival function. Specifically, we asked whether expressing HYL-1 in one of the three major tissues (intestine, neurons, or muscle), using transgenes driven by tissue-specific promoters would be sufficient to restore the L1 starvation survival in the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> animals. The expression of HYL-1 in either the intestine (<italic>ges-1</italic> promoter) or neurons (<italic>rgef-1</italic> promoter) could effectively rescue the defect of <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, C and D</xref>).

<title>Reduction of very long fatty acyl chain ceramide levels correlates with reduced L1 starvation survival</title>
<p>Ceramides are produced from sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoAs by the actions of multiple CerS, each of which has a preference for a specific fatty acyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grosch <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). The <italic>hyl-1(lf)</italic> and <italic>hyl-2(lf)</italic> mutants displayed differential starvation survival phenotypes, with the <italic>hyl-1</italic> mutant being more sensitive to starvation stress. [The mean survival rate was 13.3&#x00A0;&#x00B1;&#x00A0;0.6 for <italic>hyl-1(lf)</italic> and 15.2&#x00A0;&#x00B1;&#x00A0;0.5 for <italic>hyl-2(lf</italic>). <italic>P</italic> value for the difference of these two mutants by the Student&#x2019;s <italic>t</italic>-test is 0.034 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)].

These data suggest that levels of total ceramides, especially those with very long fatty acyl chains, promote survival of animals under starved conditions.

<title>Dietary supplementation with sphingoid bases significantly rescues the reduced L1 starvation survival of sptl-2(lf)</title>
<p>Short fatty acyl chain ceramides (C6 and C8) are soluble in DMSO, but are toxic to animals in high concentrations, and may not be physiologically relevant. The long-acyl chain ceramides (C16&#x2013;25) are insoluble in either DMSO or aqueous solution, rendering dietary supplement analysis difficult. Indeed, we failed to rescue the L1 starvation survival of either <italic>sptl-2(lf)</italic> or <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutants with dietary supplementation of ceramides containing various lengths of fatty acyl chains. In contrast, the sphingoid bases (sphinganine), which are ceramide precursors and downstream products of the serine palmitoyltransferase, have better solubility in DMSO and aqueous solution. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the majority of sphingoid bases are derived from monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (C15ISO and C17ISO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). We then examined dietary supplementation with a custom synthesized d17iso-SPA (sphinganine), and found it was able to partially rescue the L1 starvation survival of <italic>sptl-2(lf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, B and C</xref>). This result may also suggest that intestinal ceramides play prominent roles in promoting starvation survival. Furthermore, <italic>sphk-1(ok1097)</italic>, a null allele of the sphingosine kinase that causes animals to lose the ability to convert sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate, significantly rescued the L1 starvation survival of <italic>sptl-2(lf)</italic>, even though the <italic>sphk-1(ok1097)</italic> mutation alone causes only a modest reduction in L1 starvation survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, B and C</xref>). These data indicate that sphingosines, the ceramide precursors, are critical for L1 starvation survival, whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate may also have a modest role in the process.</p>

We thus analyzed the genetic interactions of <italic>CerS</italic> with <italic>unc-31</italic>, <italic>age-1</italic>, and <italic>daf-16</italic>. We found that the starvation survival defects associated with both <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutants were partially but significantly suppressed by both <italic>unc-31(lf)</italic> and <italic>age-1(rf)</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, B and C</xref>). The survival rates of <italic>CerS(rf)</italic>; <italic>unc-31(lf)</italic> and <italic>CerS(rf)</italic>; <italic>age-1(rf)</italic> mutants were more than threefold higher than that of <italic>CerS(rf)</italic>, but more than onefold lower than that of <italic>unc-31(lf)</italic> and <italic>age-1(rf)</italic>. These partial suppression data suggest that ceramide may potentially function both upstream of the IIS pathway and through IIS-independent mechanisms. To further examine their functional relationship, we combined the <italic>sptl-2(lf)</italic> allele with a <italic>daf-16(lf)</italic> allele, and found that the mean and maximum L1 starvation survival rates of this strain were significantly lower than that of either single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, C and D</xref>).

<title>Ceramide is important for maintaining starvation-induced gene expression dynamics</title>
<p>To gain further insight into how ceramide impacts starvation-response related gene expression, we further compared the transcriptome of <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutant animals during L1 diapause with previously described FedUP and StarvUP genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baugh <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). FedUP genes are expressed at higher levels when animals hatch in the presence of food, and were proposed to promote reproductive growth. In contrast, StarvUP genes are expressed at higher levels when animals hatch in the absence of food (starvation), and were proposed to support an animal&#x2019;s survival during starvation. Of the total 272 genes dysregulated by <italic>CerS(rf)</italic>, we found 95 genes (35%) are FedUP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS2.xls">Table S2</ext-link>F, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS4.docx">Table S4</ext-link>), and 90 of these 95 genes were upregulated in the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutant, indicating that ceramide functions to repress these genes during L1 diapause in wild type. Furthermore, 33 of the genes (12% of the total 272 genes) dysregulated by <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> were StarvUP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS2.xls">Table S2</ext-link>G, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS4.docx">Table S4</ext-link>). Of these 33 genes, 20 were downregulated in the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutant, indicating that ceramide promotes the expression of these genes during L1 diapause in wild type. Therefore, like <italic>Rb(lf)</italic>, <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> alters the &#x201C;starvation transcriptome&#x201D; toward a &#x201C;feeding transcriptome&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Many pathogen-inducible genes are repressed by ceramide during L1 diapause</title>
<p>GO analysis of the 272 dysregulated genes in the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutant showed that the &#x201C;immune response,&#x201D; in particular the &#x201C;innate immune response,&#x201D; is the most enriched GO category based on <italic>P</italic>-value (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS3.xls">Table S3</ext-link>). Therefore, we compared our <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> microarray datasets with pathogen-responsive gene datasets. Specifically, when the dataset of <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> was compared against the 4-hr exposure to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Troemel <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), we identified 63 dysregulated genes in <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> that were PA14_4 hr-responsive genes, which is dramatically greater than expected by chance. Of these 63 genes, 59 were upregulated in both the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutant and PA14-induced gene list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS2.xls">Table S2</ext-link>H, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS4.docx">Table S4</ext-link>). These results suggest that ceramide repressed the expression of these pathogen-inducible genes for the benefit of starvation survival. A role of repressing a large number of pathogen- and toxin-inducible genes during L1 diapause was also identified for <italic>Rb</italic> in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). As described earlier, nearly half of the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> affected genes were found to overlap with <italic>Rb(lf)</italic> affected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS2.xls">Table S2</ext-link>D). These shared activities support the idea that repressing pathogen-inducible genes is vital for protecting starvation survival. Many pathogen-inducible genes encode proteins with antimicrobial or detoxification roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoeven <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). While they function to protect animals against various environmental threats, they are likely to be harmful to the starvation-induced response for long-term survival. However, our data do not exclude the possibility that these genes are simply unresponsive to starvation stress; they are not necessarily repressed to enhance starvation survival.</p>
<p>Among the 272 genes dysregulated in <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutants, 12 are listed in a compendium of 934 predicted <italic>C. elegans</italic> transcription factors (referred to as wTF2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reece-Hoyes <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS5.docx">Table S5</ext-link>). Of the nine upregulated transcription factors, z<italic>ip-2</italic>, encoding a bZIP transcription factor, was upregulated by threefold in <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutants at <italic>P</italic>&#x00A0;&#x003C;&#x00A0;0.0025. A previous study indicated the role of <italic>zip-2</italic> in regulating an early response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that the induction of 25 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection response genes is ZIP-2 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estes <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). We found that 18 out of these 25 genes were highly induced in starved L1 animals of the <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS6.docx">Table S6</ext-link>), suggesting that the increase in <italic>zip-2</italic> expression may partially mediate the impact of <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> on the expression of pathogen response genes, which implicates a negative role of ZIP-2 in the impact of ceramide on L1 starvation survival. This negative role is also consistent with our further genetic analysis of the <italic>zip-2</italic> gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/FigureS2.pptx">Figure S2</ext-link>). However, the genetic data also suggest that <italic>zip-2</italic> may promote other cellular processes needed for starvation survival (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/FigureS2.pptx">Figure S2</ext-link>), which is consistent with the impact of <italic>zip-2(lf)</italic> on the expression of a large number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estes <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we described a strong impact of ceramide deficiency on animal survival during L1 diapause. Ceramide is an important secondary signaling molecule generated in response to multiple extracellular stimuli, such as DNA damage, cytokines, and growth factors, to regulate multiple cellular events like apoptosis, cell senescence, the cell cycle, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannun and Obeid 2008</xref>). While studies using cell culture systems have contributed the most to our current understanding of the roles of ceramide in these cellular processes, the analysis of ceramide function in stress responses using animal models has been limited. Our findings suggest that ceramide may function as a secondary messenger of the food-deprivation signal upstream of multiple stress response pathways.</p>
<p>We showed that three ceramide synthases have differential roles in the L1 starvation response. <italic>hyl-1</italic> has the most prominent role in starvation survival, whereas <italic>lagr-1</italic> has the weakest role, based on single and double mutant analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It has been shown that <italic>hyl-1</italic> is mainly responsible for synthesizing ceramides containing very-long-fatty-acyl chains (C25/C26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menuz <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). There are six mammalian CerS enzymes (CerS1&#x2013;6) that vary in their spatiotemporal expression patterns and their abilities to produce ceramides with different chain lengths (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grosch <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mullen <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Equilibrium between very-long and long-chain ceramides is also thought to be important for normal cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grosch <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Further study is needed to identify the chain-length dependence of ceramide target proteins in order to explain the molecular basis for how different ceramide species play differential roles in animal starvation survival.</p>
<p>Our analysis of ceramide-regulated genes during L1 diapause, and previous study on the function of <italic>Rb</italic> in the process, indicated that gene expression dynamics induced by starvation share common features, as well as possess distinct features from that induced by other environmental stresses, such as pathogen-induced responses. The IIS pathway has been shown to play prominent roles in animal responses to many different stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baugh and Sternberg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). However, unlike in other stressed situations when animals need to counter toxic threats, food or nutrient deprivation presents a distinct physiological challenge to cells and tissues, and thus demands unique changes in gene regulation. Our previous studies of miRNA functions also indicate sharply different roles of major miRNA functions in the intestine for starvation survival compared to that during pathogen responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kudlow <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous study showed the impact of ceramide biosynthesis on mitochondrial functions in stress response under well-fed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). We also previously reported that <italic>Rb</italic> regulates the L1 starvation response partly by promoting the expression of many mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). However, we found that the expression of most of these MRC proteins are not significantly affected by <italic>Cer(rf)</italic> mutations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/TableS2.xls">Table S2</ext-link>A), suggesting that, under starved conditions, the impact of ceramide on mitochondrial function may be limited.</p>
<p>The benefit of ceramide on starvation survival would seem to be consistent with a potential positive role of ceramide molecules in lifespan extension. Many known lifespan regulators, such as <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>mir-71</italic>, play positive roles in both lifespan extension and L1 starvation survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baugh and Sternberg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kenyon 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pincus <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulias and Horvitz 2012</xref>). However, a previous publication showed that <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains with mutations in both <italic>hyl-1</italic> and <italic>lagr-1</italic> genes, like our <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> mutants, displayed autophagy-dependent lifespan extension under well-fed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mosbech <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). It has also been shown that, while the <italic>hyl-2(lf)</italic> mutant was sensitive to anoxia, the <italic>hyl-1(lf)</italic> mutant was resistant to anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menuz <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). These findings suggest that the poor L1 survival rate of <italic>CerS(rf)</italic> animals is not due to a general sickness, or a nonspecific sensitivity to all stresses. In addition, these observations also raise an interesting question regarding whether, under well-fed conditions, ceramide has roles that are distinct from roles observed under starved conditions. It has also been previously reported that ceramide inhibits insulin sensitivity in mammals under nutrient-rich conditions, which potentially renders individuals at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chavez and Summers 2012</xref>). More investigation is clearly needed to learn about the mechanisms underlying the benefits and detriments of ceramide under both starved and well fed conditions.</p>
<p>The appropriate level of autophagy is required for optimal starvation survival of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang and Avery 2009</xref>). To investigate whether an abnormal level of autophagy contributes to the poor starvation response of mutants in the ceramide synthesis pathway, we examined the level of autophagic activation in <italic>sptl-2(lf)</italic> animals. There was no significant difference in the autophagic response between <italic>sptl-2(lf)</italic> and wild-type animals during L1 starvation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.194282/-/DC1/FigureS3.pptx">Figure S3</ext-link>), suggesting that <italic>sptl-2(lf)</italic> affects L1 starvation survival mainly through autophagy-independent mechanisms.</p>
<p>Ceramide has been previously suggested to function as a tumor-suppressor lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morad and Cabot 2013</xref>). Our study reveals that ceramide promotes animal starvation survival. Previous studies also showed that tumor suppressor genes, <italic>daf-16/Foxo</italic>, <italic>daf-18/Pten</italic>, and <italic>lin-35/Rb</italic> are required for promoting <italic>C. elegans</italic> starvation survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baugh and Sternberg 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Starvation or fasting has recently been investigated in cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naveed <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cangemi <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), as tumor cells are thought to be more susceptible to starvation due to the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iansante <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Results from this study and previous work using <italic>C. elegans</italic> may suggest that cancer cells, that commonly harbor mutations in tumor suppressor genes, are highly sensitive to starvation stress.</p>
