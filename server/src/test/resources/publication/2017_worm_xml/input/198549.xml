<body>
<p>A cell&#x2019;s fate and function are determined by its transcriptome and proteome. The transcriptomes of germ cells are unique and are comprised of RNAs that encode proteins essential for specialized, germ cell-specific functions, such as meiosis, spermatogenesis, and oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesch and Page 2012</xref>). Throughout development, germ cells must maintain expression of germline-specific genes as well as repress genes that would lead to somatic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strome and Updike 2015</xref>). Failure to maintain appropriate gene-expression programs can lead to sterility, preventing an organism from passing its genetic information to future generations.</p>
<p>A conserved feature of germ cells is the presence of electron-dense, nonmembrane-bound organelles called germ granules, which include polar granules in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, chromatoid bodies in mouse spermatids, Balbiani bodies in mouse oocytes, and P granules in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voronina <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Germ granules are typically associated with the cytoplasmic face of germ cell nuclei and have been observed to overlie clusters of nuclear pores in worms, zebrafish, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knaut <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pitt <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuma <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Many essential germ-granule factors are known or predicted to bind RNA. Thus, germ granules are suspected to serve as post-transcriptional processing centers to modify, degrade, and/or store messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as they exit germ cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheth <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Updike and Strome 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voronina <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, P granules are maternally loaded into the one-cell embryo and then asymmetrically segregated to the germ lineage during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Updike and Strome 2010</xref>). Although segregation of the bulk of maternal P granules to the germline blastomeres is not required for germ cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallo <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), P granules are required for proper germ cell development and may protect germ cells from stressful conditions such as high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawasaki <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spike <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallo <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). The PGL and GLH proteins make up the core constitutive components of P granules. The three PGL proteins are worm specific. The two most important PGL proteins, PGL-1 and PGL-3, contain a predicted RNA-binding motif at their C terminus called an RGG (Arg-Gly-Gly) box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawasaki <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2004</xref>). The four GLH proteins are homologs of the highly conserved Vasa protein and contain DEAD-box helicase domains, which may also bind and modulate RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruidl <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuznicki <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spike <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). The most important GLH protein, GLH-1, is necessary for P-granule retention at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In addition to the PGL and GLH core components, P granules contain proteins involved in small-RNA biogenesis and the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, suggesting that P granules are involved in small-RNA regulation in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Updike and Strome 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasper <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, P granules have been implicated in maintaining germ cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Germ cells that are depleted of the most important P-granule components (PGL-1, PGL-3, GLH-1, and GLH-4) sometimes express a neuron-specific transgene and a muscle-specific myosin, supporting the hypothesis that P granules prevent somatic development in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. These findings raise many questions, including: (1) What is the extent of somatic development in P granule-depleted germlines? (2) Is any particular somatic fate favored over others? (3) How early do P granule-depleted germ cells start expressing somatic markers? (4) What is the mechanism by which P granules prevent expression of somatic genes in the germline?</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of P granules in maintaining appropriate transcript accumulation patterns in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. Using transcript profiling and single molecule RNA-FISH (smFISH) of dissected gonads, we show that upon depletion of P granules, major changes in mRNA levels occur in the germline. Those changes include persistence of sperm transcripts past the normal sperm-production period in hermaphrodites and progressive upregulation of transcripts from numerous genes normally expressed only in somatic cells. P granule-depleted germ cells express numerous genes involved in neuronal fate and differentiation, and those cells lose their germ cell identity, highlighting the antagonistic relationship between germ and somatic fates. Finally, we show that germlines that lack either PGL-1 or GLH-1 also misexpress somatic markers, suggesting that these factors are critical for P-granule function. Our studies show that a key role of P granules is to maintain germ cell identity, perhaps by regulating the stability and/or transcription of target mRNAs.</p>

<title>Gonad isolation and RNA extraction</title>
<p>For experiments using RNAi, synchronized <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> L1 worms (P0) were placed on HT115 bacteria containing empty RNAi vector (control) or expressing double-strand RNA that targets P granules (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>pgl-1</italic>, <italic>pgl-3</italic>, <italic>glh-1</italic>, and <italic>glh-4</italic>) or targets <italic>pgl-1</italic> or <italic>pgl-1</italic>; <italic>pgl-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike 2015</xref>) at 24&#x00B0; (day 0). Three days later, F<sub>1</sub> larvae were transferred to new control or P-granule RNAi plates and returned to 24&#x00B0;. The majority of these F<sub>1</sub> larvae were at the L1 or L2 stage at the time of transfer. The next day (day 4), L4 worms were visually identified by their size and the presence of a white crescent at their vulva. Gonads were dissected from L4 control worms and L4 P-granule RNAi worms and cut at the gonad bend with 301/2-gauge needles in egg buffer (pH 7.3, 27.5 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl, 2.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.528 mM KCl) containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1 mM levamisole. Sterility could not be assessed in L4 worms. However, &#x003E;80% sterility was observed in P-granule RNAi adults that were aged from the population of worms from which L4 gonads were collected. For day 1 adults, worms were allowed to age 1 day past the L4 stage and then dissected. For day 2 adults, worms were allowed to age 2 days past the L4 stage and then dissected. In day 2 adults, gonads that visually expressed the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene were identified using a Leica MZ16F fluorescence stereomicroscope and collected as a separate sample from those that did not detectably express <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>. For adult control gonads, gonads were dissected from fully fertile worms and cut at the gonad bend. For adult P-granule RNAi worms, gonads were collected only from sterile worms, as judged by the lack of embryos in the uterus. Large P-granule RNAi gonads were cut at the gonad bend; stunted P-granule RNAi gonads were collected in their entirety. Once dissected, gonad arms were collected in Trizol, and total RNA was extracted. For control samples, 75&#x2013;100 gonads were collected per replicate. For P-granule RNAi samples, 125&#x2013;150 gonads were collected per replicate. Three biological replicates were performed for each treatment and time point.</p>
<p>For experiments using P-granule mutants, wild type (control), <italic>pgl-1</italic> single mutants, or <italic>glh-1</italic> single mutant adults [isolated from <italic>glh-1(gk100)/hT2(qIs48)</italic> balanced parents] were allowed to lay eggs overnight on OP50 bacteria at 24&#x00B0;. The day after the egg lay, the adults were removed and the F<sub>1</sub> progeny were returned to 24&#x00B0; for 2 days. Day 1 adult gonads were dissected, collected into Trizol, and total RNA was extracted. Only distal gonad arms were collected from fertile wild-type worms or sterile P-granule mutant worms, as judged by the lack of embryos in the uterus. Three biological replicates were performed for the wild-type and <italic>pgl-1</italic> samples, and two biological replicates were performed for the <italic>glh-1</italic> sample.</p>

<title>Transcript profiling and analysis</title>
<p>Ribosomal RNA was depleted from each RNA sample using an NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (catalog number E6310), and libraries were constructed using an NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina sequencing (catalog number E7530). Because of the kit&#x2019;s size selection steps, small RNAs could not be analyzed. Libraries were sequenced at the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, using the Illumina HiSequation 2000, 2500, and 4000 platforms. Raw sequences were mapped to transcriptome version WS220 using TopHat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Only reads with one unique mapping were allowed; otherwise default options were used. Reads mapping to ribosomal RNAs were removed from further analysis. DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Love <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) was used for differential expression analysis. A Benjamini&#x2013;Hochberg multiple hypothesis corrected <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff of 0.05 was used as a significance cutoff. Read counts for each gene were normalized using the size factor normalization function in DESeq2 to &#x223C;3.5 million reads genome wide per condition, after which replicate values were averaged. Gene ontology analysis was done using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resource version 6.7.</p>

<title>Gene categories</title>
<p>Gene categories were defined using published microarray and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data sets that profiled specific tissues or whole worms which contained or lacked a germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baugh <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reinke <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meissner <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rechtsteiner <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knutson <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref>. Ubiquitous genes (1895 genes) are genes that are expressed (tag &#x003E; 0) in all SAGE data sets that profiled germline, muscle, neuronal, and gut tissue; but that are not in the germline-enriched category. Germline-enriched genes (2230 genes) are genes with transcripts enriched in adults with a germline compared with adults lacking a germline as assessed by microarray analysis. Germline-specific genes (169 genes) are genes whose transcripts are expressed exclusively in the adult germline and accumulate in embryos strictly by maternal contribution. Sperm-specific genes (858 genes) are genes in the spermatogenesis-enriched category as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reinke <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref>, minus genes in the germline-enriched and germline-specific categories. Soma-specific genes (1181 genes) are genes expressed (tag &#x003E; 4) in muscle, neuronal, and/or gut tissue; but not expressed (tag = 0) in germline SAGE data sets and also not in the germline-enriched category. A gene&#x2019;s membership within a gene category is indicated in Supplemental Material, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS1.xlsx">File S1</ext-link>, with 1 denoting membership in a gene category and 0 denoting not within a gene category.</p>

Among UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads, &#x223C;60% also coexpressed the muscle myosin MYO-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). UNC-119::GFP and MYO-3 were often observed in the same regions of the germline, and those regions showed morphological changes not typical of germ cells (<italic>i.e.</italic>, loss of the rachis, loss of proper germ cell organization, and abnormal nuclear size). These features raise the possibility that depletion of P granules causes germ cells to undergo large-scale developmental changes in gene expression.</p>
<p>To identify genes that become misregulated upon depletion of P granules and to investigate the extent of reprogramming toward somatic cell types, we performed transcriptome analysis of dissected gonads from P granule-depleted worms compared to control worms. We treated L1 larvae that harbored the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene with P-granule RNAi and manually dissected and collected gonads from their F<sub>1</sub> progeny at different developmental stages: L4 larvae, day 1 sterile adults, and day 2 sterile adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). Throughout this report, we use the shorthand &#x201C;L4&#x201D; to mean the L4 larval stage and &#x201C;PG(&#x2212;)&#x201D; to mean P-granule depleted. Of the day 2 sterile adults, &#x223C;10% expressed the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene in one or both gonad arms. These &#x201C;transformed&#x201D; gonads [<italic>i.e.</italic>, day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads] were collected as a separate sample from day 2 gonads that did not detectably express the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene [<italic>i.e.</italic>, day 2 adult PG(-) UNC-119::GFP(&#x2212;) gonads; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>]. For comparison, worms were fed empty vector RNAi instead of P-granule RNAi, and control gonads were collected from fertile F<sub>1</sub> worms at the same developmental stages (L4, day 1 adult, and day 2 adult). From control worms, only the distal halves of gonads were profiled by cutting at the gonad bend so as to avoid oocytes, which are not present in PG(&#x2212;) gonads. From PG(&#x2212;) worms, large gonads were cut at the gonad bend and stunted gonads were collected in their entirety. Three biological replicates were collected for each treatment at each time point. Total RNA was isolated from these replicates, depleted of ribosomal RNA, and used to construct libraries for next-generation sequencing.</p>

<p>Our P granule-depletion method was highly effective. Compared to control gonads, PG(&#x2212;) gonads at all three developmental stages showed between a 9- and 133-fold reduction in <italic>pgl-1</italic>, <italic>pgl-3</italic>, <italic>glh-1</italic>, and <italic>glh-4</italic> transcripts (Figure S1, A and B, in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>); and immunostaining of larval worms showed that PGL-1 levels were below detection in 60% of L1s (<italic>n</italic> = 131) and in 100% of L4s (<italic>n</italic> = 53 gonad arms). In addition to the four P-granule targets included in our RNAi construct, our P-granule RNAi also depleted <italic>glh-2</italic> and the DEAD-box helicase domain-containing pseudogene <italic>T08D2.3</italic>, likely due to their extensive sequence identity with <italic>glh-1</italic> and <italic>glh-4</italic>. The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser tracks of these P-granule loci revealed read pileups spanning &#x223C;350 bp (Figure S1A in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). Based on their mapped locations, we infer that these reads originate from the RNAi construct. We also observed a fourfold increase of a portion of <italic>unc-119</italic> transcripts in day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads compared to day 2 adult control gonads (Figure S1C in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). The reads that mapped to <italic>unc-119</italic> are most likely from the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene and not the endogenous <italic>unc-119</italic> locus, since only exons 2, 3, and half of 4 were upregulated and only those exons are present in the transgene. Taken together, these data show that our P granule-RNAi treatment is highly effective at depleting P-granule mRNAs and that day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads upregulate transcription of the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene.</p>

<title>PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads display progressive changes in transcript accumulation</title>
<p>We observed genome-wide changes in transcript accumulation in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads compared to control gonads. Using cut offs of an adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x003C;0.05 and a fold change of more than twofold, we identified 2383 genes as significantly upregulated and 127 genes as significantly downregulated in day 1 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(&#x2212;) gonads compared to day 1 adult control gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Allowing worms to age to day 2 of adulthood resulted in 6833 genes significantly upregulated and 965 genes significantly downregulated in day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(&#x2212;) gonads compared to day 2 adult control gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads showed even greater transcript accumulation changes when compared to day 2 adult control gonads: 8777 genes significantly upregulated and 3049 genes significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparison of the different up- and downregulated genes from each adult sample revealed high overlap but also unique genes within later gonad samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The nested Venn diagrams suggest that gene misexpression in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads becomes progressively more severe over time, especially in gonads that express a somatic transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>PG(&#x2212;) L4 larval gonads display little change in transcript accumulation</title>
<p>In contrast to day 1 and day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) gonads, L4 PG(&#x2212;) gonads showed essentially no transcript accumulation changes compared to L4 control gonads; only 9 genes were significantly downregulated and 12 genes significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of the nine downregulated genes, five genes were direct P granule-RNAi targets (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>pgl-1</italic>, <italic>pgl-3</italic>, <italic>glh-1</italic>, <italic>glh-4</italic>, and <italic>glh-2</italic>) and two genes were likely the result of 3&#x2032;&#x2013;5&#x2032; transitive RNAi spreading (<italic>him-3</italic> and <italic>hil-4</italic> are at the 5&#x2032; ends of <italic>pgl-1</italic> and <italic>pgl-3</italic>, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>him-3</italic> is transcribed in the opposite direction of <italic>pgl-1</italic>, suggesting that transitive RNAi operates in the nucleus and can affect genes with opposite polarity from the target gene. Another gene, <italic>T12F5.2</italic>, is downregulated as a result of being in the same operon as <italic>glh-4</italic>. The 12 genes significantly upregulated in PG(&#x2212;) L4 gonads did not fall into any specific gene ontology category.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of all seven samples revealed clustering of the day 1 and day 2 adult control gonad samples close to each other and far from the L4 control sample and all of the PG(&#x2212;) samples along principal component 1 (PC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, the control L4 gonad sample is similar to all of the PG(&#x2212;) samples along PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This, along with results discussed below, suggests that gonads isolated from PG(&#x2212;) adult worms are developmentally more similar to L4 gonads than adult gonads and possibly maintain mRNAs that are normally restricted to the L4 stage. These results suggest that P granules are necessary for the normal progression of germline development from the L4 stage to adult. The PG(&#x2212;) samples spread out along PC2, with the day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonad sample being farthest from the others. This likely reflects differences in transcript accumulation that may underlie somatic development in transformed day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads.</p>

<title>PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads downregulate germline transcripts and upregulate somatic and sperm transcripts</title>
<p>To determine the types of genes that are misregulated in response to P-granule depletion, we analyzed the levels of mapped reads across different gene categories: ubiquitously expressed, enriched expression in the germline, expressed specifically in the germline, expressed specifically in sperm, or expressed specifically in somatic cells. These categories were defined previously using microarray and SAGE data from different tissues and from animals that possessed or lacked a germline (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). After normalizing for sequencing depth across all seven samples, we compared average read counts across different gene categories.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous genes displayed constant levels of read counts across all seven samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Closer examination of individual genes revealed a small subset of ubiquitous genes that showed upregulation in PG(&#x2212;) gonads, especially in day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads (Figure S2A in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). However, for the majority of ubiquitous genes, including <italic>ama-1</italic> which encodes the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, read levels were not changed by P-granule depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Germline-enriched and germline-specific gene read counts in control gonads increased progressively from L4 larvae to day 1 adults to day 2 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Upon P-granule depletion, L4 PG(&#x2212;), day 1 adult PG(&#x2212;), and day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(&#x2212;) gonads showed levels of reads across germline genes that were similar to levels observed in L4 control gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Those levels dropped in day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads compared to day 2 adult control gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure S2B in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). Examples of germline transcripts that were downregulated include transcripts encoding the P granule-associated argonaute CSR-1 and the P granule-associated translational repressor GLD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that P granules are required for the normal accumulation of germline transcripts and prevent the decrease in germline mRNAs in gonads that express the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene.</p>
<p>Sperm genes displayed elevated read counts in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads compared to control adult gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, A and D</xref>). In hermaphrodite worms, spermatogenesis occurs during the L4 larval stage and ends at the L4-to-adult molt, at which time oogenesis begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirsh <italic>et al.</italic> 1976</xref>). Consistent with this, transcripts from sperm-specific genes, such as the <italic>msp</italic> genes that encode major sperm proteins (MSPs), accumulated in L4 gonads and then abruptly declined from control adult gonads. However, these transcripts remained elevated in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and Figure S2C in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>), supporting the suggestion from PCA analysis that P granules are necessary for germlines to progress from L4 to adulthood. These data are consistent with a recent study that also detected perdurance of sperm transcripts in P-granule RNAi day 1 adult gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Soma-specific genes showed several patterns of increased transcript accumulation in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and Figures S3 and S4 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). Some soma-specific transcripts accumulated in a pattern resembling sperm transcripts [transcripts detected in L4 gonads, downregulated in control adult gonads, and present at elevated levels in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads], includ<!-- Q7 -->ing the &#x03B1;-2(IV) collagen mRNA, <italic>let-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)<!-- DBComment7 -->.

In contrast to genes like <italic>let-2</italic>, <italic>cebp-1</italic>, and <italic>puf-9</italic>; some soma-specific transcripts were only significantly upregulated in day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads, including <italic>aqp-2</italic>, which encodes a membrane-bound aquaporin that is normally expressed in the excretory cell, muscle cells, motor neurons, and the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although different somatic genes displayed different patterns of upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), as a whole, the levels of somatic gene transcripts progressively increased over time and with expression of the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure S2D in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>).</p>
<p>As an unbiased, genome-wide approach to determine different gene-expression patterns among our samples, we also performed K-means clustering using the fold changes of RNAs in PG(&#x2212;) gonads <italic>vs.</italic> their paired controls (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). The 14,571 genes that showed a significant fold change in at least one of our comparisons were groupe<!-- Q8 -->d into eight clusters<!-- DBComment8 -->. The majority of ubiquitous genes, germline-enriched genes, and germline-specific genes grouped into cluster 1; and the majority of sperm-specific genes grouped into cluster 4 (Figures S3 and S4 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). This shows that these genes act similarly within their assigned gene category; that is, the majority of germline genes show similar responses to P-granule depletion, as do the majority of sperm genes. Somatic genes were spread out among the rest of the clusters (clusters 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8; Figure S3 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>), supporting our observation that P-granule depletion causes several patterns of misregulation of soma-specific transcripts. Some somatic transcripts became more prevalent at progressively later stages (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>cebp-1</italic> in cluster 2), while others that were detected in L4 gon<!-- Q9 -->ads were reduced in control adult gonads, and persisted in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads (<italic>e.g</italic><!-- DBComment9 -->., <italic>let-2</italic> in cluster 6). We suspect that the somatic genes that become highly expressed in UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>aqp-2</italic> and certain genes in clusters 2, 3, and 6) are due to indirect, secondary effects of P-granule loss (see <italic>Discussion</italic>). Taken together, our transcript profiling shows that P granules are necessary to promote appropriate transcript accumulation patterns in gonads after the L4 larval stage.</p>

<title>smFISH analysis confirms that somatic transcripts accumulate in PG(&#x2212;) gonads</title>
<p>Although our RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) method is highly sensitive, it is unable to provide spatial information about transcript accumulation patterns within gonads. As an independent method to test if, when, and where soma-specific transcripts are upregulated in PG(&#x2212;) germ cells, we performed smFISH using probes to detect several soma-specific mRNAs (<italic>cebp-1</italic>, <italic>aqp-2</italic>, <italic>let-2</italic>, and <italic>puf-9</italic>) in control and PG(&#x2212;) gonads.</p>

We did detect some <italic>cebp-1</italic> transcripts around the nuclei of somatic gonad cells; including the very distal tip of the gonad, likely the somatic distal tip cell; in day 1 and day 2 adult control gonads, but no signal was detected in the germline. Upon P-granule depletion, individual <italic>cebp-1</italic> mRNA molecules were present throughout the germ cell region of day 1 and day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(&#x2212;) gonads as well as day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, 58% of day 1 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(&#x2212;) gonads (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and 100% of day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads (<italic>n</italic> = 13) had <italic>cebp-1</italic> transcripts throughout the germ cell region. Unlike <italic>cebp-1</italic> transcripts, which were detected in younger PG(&#x2212;) gonads by RNA-seq, <italic>aqp-2</italic> transcripts were only upregulated in day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

In day 2 adult control gonads, <italic>let-2</italic> transcripts were mostly gone, with only a few transcripts remaining at the distal tip (Figure S5 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). In contrast, in 54% (<italic>n</italic> = 36) of day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads, <italic>let-2</italic> transcripts were present throughout the gonad, frequently concentrated in regions around the nuclei of germ cells (Figure S5 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). By RNA-seq, levels of <italic>puf-9</italic> transcripts were low in control gonads and elevated in both adult stages lacking P granules (Figure S6A in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). By smFISH, <italic>puf-9</italic> transcripts were also detected throughout the distal half of the germline in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads: 71% of day 1 adult PG(&#x2212;) (<italic>n</italic> = 45) and 90% of day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) (<italic>n</italic> = 19) (Figure S6B in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). Very few <italic>puf-9</italic> transcripts were detected in the distal half of control gonads. We did detect <italic>puf-9</italic> transcripts in the proximal half of both control and PG(&#x2212;) gonads. Taken together, our smFISH analysis corroborates our RNA-seq results and confirms that soma-specific transcripts are upregulated in PG(&#x2212;) germ cells.</p>
<p>Our smFISH results shed light on the subset of soma-specific transcripts that are detected in L4 gonads, are reduced in control adult gonads, but persist in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>let-2</italic> transcripts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; cluster 6 in Figures S3 and S4 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.116.198549/-/DC1/FileS2.pdf">File S2</ext-link>). Based on our RNA-seq data alone, two explanations are possible. One possibility is that these transcripts are expressed in germ cells at the L4 stage and then disappear in a P granule-dependent manner in adult gonads, similar to sperm transcripts. An alternative possibility is that these transcripts reside in the somatic gonad and appear to be downregulated in control adult gonads and upregulated in PG(&#x2212;) adult gonads because of the altered ratio of somatic gonad cells to germ cells, <italic>i.e.</italic>, a lower ratio in control adults and a higher ratio in PG(&#x2212;) adults with stunted germlines. Illustrating the latter possibility, our smFISH analysis detected <italic>Iet-2</italic> transcripts in the somatic gonad of L4s. However, <italic>let-2</italic> transcripts were later expressed in the germ cells of UNC-119::GFP(+) adults, along with many other somatic transcripts (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>cebp-1</italic>, <italic>aqp-2</italic>, and <italic>puf-9</italic>). Thus, even somatic gonad markers can become expressed in the germlines of reprogrammed adults. Further research is needed to identify the direct <italic>vs.</italic> indirect effects that P granules have on individual genes.</p>

<title>UNC-119::GFP(+) germ cells lose germline identity</title>

To test if UNC-119::GFP(+) cells lose germ cell identity upon acquisition of a neuronal fate, we stained day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads for the germline proteins REC-8 and HTP-3, and performed smFISH to detect <italic>lag-1</italic> transcripts. REC-8 is a cohesin found in the mitotic stem cell region of germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansen <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), and HTP-3 is an integral component of the synaptonemal complex present in the meiotic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, A and C</xref>). LAG-1 is a transcription factor that works downstream of Notch signaling to control germ cell entry into meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crittenden <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). In day 2 adult PG(&#x2212;) UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads, we observed a mutually exclusive pattern of UNC-119::GFP and REC-8 staining; cells that expressed UNC-119::GFP lacked REC-8 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, A and B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although germ granules were first observed &#x003E;100 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter 1890</xref>), their functions are only starting to be understood at the molecular level. <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ granules or &#x201C;P granules&#x201D; are necessary for germline development and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawasaki <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spike <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and protect the germline from expressing somatic fate markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). In this study, we analyzed the progressive transcript changes that occur in PG(&#x2212;) germlines. We treated worms with P-granule RNAi for two generations and performed transcriptome analysis of dissected gonads from the second-generation sterile hermaphrodites. In worms that lack P granules, germlines appear relatively healthy at the L4 stage but deteriorate in adults. Germline deterioration in adults is accompanied by, and perhaps caused by, aberrant persistence of sperm-specific transcripts after the sperm-production period in L4, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike 2015</xref>), and elevated levels of soma-specific transcripts. The persistence of sperm-specific transcripts into adulthood suggests that P granules promote progression of germ cells from the L4 larval stage to adulthood, and the healthy appearance and normal RNA profile of L4 germlines suggest that P granules may not be necessary for germline development during the larval stages. In adults, the majority of PG(&#x2212;) germlines become reduced in size and disorganized, while a minority of germlines appear to proliferate; both categories of germlines can contain cells that have lost their previous germ cell fate and appear to be on a neuronal developmental path. Taken together, these findings reveal that <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ granules are major regulators of the germline transcriptome and prevent germ cells from undergoing somatic development, possibly by preventing the expression of somatic factors in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The mechanism by which P granules perform these functions remains to be determined.</p>
<fig id="fig8" position="float" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Models of P-granule function. P granules reside over nuclear pores, where they intercept stochastically misexpressed soma-specific mRNAs (red mRNAs), while allowing germline-appropriate mRNAs (green mRNAs) to transit to the cytoplasm for translation. (Left panel) In model A, P granules prevent the translation of somatic mRNAs. (Middle panel) In model B, P granules slice somatic mRNAs into small RNAs, which in turn induce heritable silencing of somatic genes. (Right panel) In the absence of P granules, somatic mRNAs accumulate and are translated into proteins (red) that specify somatic identity and antagonize germline identity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gen.198549fig8"></graphic></fig>
<p>P granules reside on the outer periphery of germ cell nuclei and overlie nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pitt <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheth <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). It has been proposed that as mRNAs exit the nucleus, P granules intercept and perhaps process these transcripts, thus influencing the transcriptome and proteome of the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasper <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Indeed, some germline transcripts have been shown to at least transiently reside in P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schisa <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheth <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Recently, PGL-1 was shown to dimerize and to have guanosine-specific RNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). This raises the possibility that PGL-1 directly influences the transcriptome by cleaving its associated mRNAs, although PGL-1&#x2019;s catalytic activity is not essential for its role in fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). If PGL-1 does indeed have RNase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, then an attractive scenario is that it recognizes mRNAs inappropriate for germline development and cleaves them, while allowing germline-appropriate mRNAs to pass through P granules and be translated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Alternatively, PGL-1 and the paralogous protein PGL-3 may not have a preference for transcript type. Indeed, PGL-3 was recently shown to bind mRNA in extracts and <italic>in vitro</italic> in a sequence-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saha <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). One possibility is that P granules intercept all types of transcripts, including germline-appropriate transcripts, but effectively prevent low levels of stochastically expressed soma-specific transcripts from producing levels of proteins that would threaten germ cell identity.</p>
<p>Our study extends a recent analysis of transcripts from day 1 adult P granule-RNAi gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike 2015</xref>) and documents the progressive appearance of somatic transcripts that underlies the germ-toward-soma reprogramming we previously observed in older PG(&#x2212;) adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike (2015)</xref> documented perdurance of sperm-specific transcripts in day 1 adult PG(&#x2212;) gonads, as we describe in both day 1 and day 2 PG(&#x2212;) adults, but they did not detect increased accumulation of soma-specific transcripts in their samples. The day 1 adult worms sampled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike (2015)</xref> experienced weaker RNAi (based on RNA read counts from RNAi target genes) and contained healthier germlines than in our experiments. Thus, the defects observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike (2015)</xref> are probably the earliest defects and likely include the primary defects caused by P-granule depletion. Our stronger RNAi and additional analysis of day 2 adults with progressively reprogrammed germlines identified additional consequences, probably many secondary consequences, of P-granule depletion. Based on their observations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike (2015)</xref> concluded that P granules likely repress translation of soma-specific mRNAs that are already present at low levels in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, model A). Our data suggest that P granules additionally affect the levels of soma-specific mRNAs in the germline, possibly by degrading soma-specific mRNAs and/or repressing transcription of soma-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasper <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, model B).</p>
<p>Consistent with P granules functioning as regulators of mRNA accumulation in the germline, many RNAi factors localize to P granules, including Dicer/DCR-1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase EGO-1, and the argonaute proteins PRG-1 and CSR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batista <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claycomb <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). PRG-1 is a Piwi-related argonaute that prevents the expression of foreign genetic elements, including transposon and transgene mRNAs. PRG-1 recognizes these mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with its associated 21U-RNAs, resulting in heritable silencing of transposon and transgene loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batista <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shirayama <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagijn <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). To maintain germline identity, PRG-1 may work with P-granule proteins to recognize and degrade soma-specific transcripts identified as &#x201C;foreign.&#x201D; This information could then be relayed back into the nucleus to repress inappropriately activated, soma-specific genes through epigenetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasper <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). CSR-1, another P granule-associated argonaute, recognizes its targets through associated 22G-RNAs that base pair with germline-expressed mRNAs including those important for embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claycomb <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Interestingly, CSR-1 was recently found to tune the levels of certain germline mRNAs in a manner that is dependent on its slicer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerson-Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Importantly, depletion of CSR-1 and depletion of P granules cause similar transcript accumulation changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Updike 2015</xref>), strengthening the link between argonautes and P granules in regulating the germline transcriptome.</p>
<p>The development of different neuronal subtypes can be induced in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline by simultaneous removal of certain chromatin factors and forced expression of master neuronal transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tursun <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patel <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), highlighting the plasticity of the germline. Notably, other genetic perturbations have been shown to cause <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells to express neuronal and muscle markers, without the need for driving transcription factors. These include loss of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET-2, loss of the nuclear argonaute HRDE-1, and concomitant loss of the NuRD complex component LET-418 and the H3K4 demethylase SPR-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaser-Pebernard <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robert <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Because these are chromatin-based factors, they are likely to have direct effects on gene transcription. One possibility is that these factors work downstream of P granules and interpret the RNA-processing events that occur within P granules. Comparing the transcriptome of gonads lacking P granules to the transcriptomes of <italic>set-2</italic> or <italic>let-418</italic>; <italic>spr-5</italic> mutant gonads may provide insight into how these regulatory mechanisms operate and influence each other to protect germ cell identity.</p>
<p>Our gene ontology analysis of genes uniquely upregulated in PG(&#x2212;) gonads from day 2 adults expressing the <italic>unc-119</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> neuronal transgene revealed processes in neuronal development. Interestingly, processes involved in muscle development and function were not observed, despite the fact that 60% of UNC-119::GFP(+) gonads also express the muscle myosin MYO-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Updike <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Perhaps many fewer PG(&#x2212;) germ cells upregulate genes involved in muscle development than upregulate genes involved in neuronal development, which would bias our transcriptome analysis in favor of genes involved in neuron-related processes.</p>
<p>The expression of many neuronal genes in PG(&#x2212;) day 2 adult germlines is likely to be a secondary effect of P-granule loss. The burning challenges are to identify the primary effect(s) of P-granule loss, and to determine why PG(&#x2212;) germ cells appear to favor a neuronal path. One possibility is that the UNC-119::GFP transgene contributes to reprogramming PG(&#x2212;) germ cells toward a neuronal fate. Although <italic>unc-119</italic> is conserved from worms to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maduro <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) and is essential for proper development of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knobel <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>), its molecular function remains unknown. If endogenous UNC-119 works upstream of many neuronal genes, then perhaps even low expression of the UNC-119::GFP transgene in cells with broad developmental potential [<italic>i.e.</italic>, PG(&#x2212;) germ cells] can cause these cells to acquire a neuronal identity. However, we note that the transgene encodes only the amino terminal half (the first 100 aa) of UNC-119. Another possibility is that PG(&#x2212;) germ cells are reverting to a &#x201C;default&#x201D; neuronal differentiation program, which has been observed in the contexts of dissociated <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs) grown in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato and Sargent 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tropepe <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). To acquire neuronal fate through this default program, ESCs must be cultured at low density and in growth factor-free conditions, suggesting an inherent propensity of ESCs to differentiate into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smukler <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Recently, the transcription factor BLIMP1 was found to be essential to reprogram human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Interestingly, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref> attempted to derive PGC-like cells from <italic>BLIMP1&#x2212;/&#x2212;</italic> hiPSCs, essential PGC genes were not expressed and genes involved in neuronal differentiation were upregulated instead. These and our findings suggest that neuronal fate is the preferred somatic fate of cells that lose their pluripotent stem cell or germline identity. Future work should investigate if <italic>C. elegans</italic> germlines that lack P granules revert to a default neuronal program and, if so, how the neuronal program becomes activated and why it becomes activated in adults and not larval germlines.</p>
<p>The breadth of ribonucleoprotein complexes and the regulatory circuits they form within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline highlight the complex nature of this tissue. To fully understand P-granule function, a thorough analysis of individual factors like PGL-1 and GLH-1 will need to be performed, especially at the biochemical level. Additionally, identification of P granule-associated mRNAs may provide insight into how P granules prevent somatic development in the germline. Finally, because many P-granule proteins are conserved in other species, it is important to test if germ granules in other organisms including vertebrates prevent somatic development of germ cells.</p>
