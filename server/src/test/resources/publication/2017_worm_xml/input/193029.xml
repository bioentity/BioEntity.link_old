<abstract>
<p>We study the mechanisms that guide the formation and maintenance of the highly ordered actin-myosin cytoskeleton in striated muscle. The UNC-82 kinase of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is orthologous to mammalian kinases ARK5/NUAK1 and SNARK/NUAK2. UNC-82 localizes to the M-line, and is required for proper organization of thick filaments, but <!-- Q1 -->its substrate and mechanism of action are unknown<!-- DBComment1 -->. Antibody staining of three mutants with missense mutations in the UNC-82 catalytic domain revealed muscle structure that is less disorganized than in the null <italic>unc-82(0)</italic>, but contained distinctive ectopic accumulations not found in <italic>unc-82(0)</italic>. These accumulations contain paramyosin and myosin B, but lack myosin A<!-- Q2 --><!-- Q3 --><!-- Q4 --> and myosin A-associated proteins, as well as proteins of the integrin-associated complex<!-- DBComment2 --> <!-- DBComment3 --> <!-- DBComment4 -->. Fluorescently tagged missense mutant protein<!-- Q5 --> UNC-82 E424K localized normally in wild type; however, in <italic>unc-82(0)</italic>, the tagged protein was found in the ectopic accumulations, which we also show to label with recently synthesized paramyosin<!-- DBComment5 -->. Recruitment of wild<!-- Q6 -->-type UNC-82::GFP to aggregates of differing protein composition in five muscle-affecting mutants revealed that colocalization of UNC-82 and paramyosin does not require UNC-96, UNC-98/ZnF, UNC-89/obscurin, CSN-5, myosin A, or myosin B individually<!-- DBComment6 -->. Dosage effects in paramyosin mutants suggest that UNC-82 acts as part of a complex, in which its stoichiometric relationship with paramyosin is critical. UNC-82 dosage affects muscle organization in the absence of paramyosin, perhaps through myosin B. We present evidence that the interaction of UNC-98/ZnF with myosin A is independent of UNC-82, and that UNC-82 acts upstream of UNC-98/ZnF in a pathway that organizes paramyosin during thick filament assembly.</p>

<body>
<p>THE nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been an excellent system for discovery and study of proteins important for proper muscle cell structure and function (reviewed<!-- Q7 --> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waterston 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moerman and Fire 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moerman and Williams 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gieseler <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>)<!-- DBComment7 -->. The contractile apparatus of striated muscle is a highly ordered array of interdigitated actin thin filaments and myosin thick filaments. The myosin filaments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> contain myosin A, myosin B, paramyosin, and the filagenins. The nematode thick filament has been modeled to consist of a series of concentric layers, with an outer layer containing myosins A and B, an intermediate layer of paramyosin, and an inner layer or core of paramyosin and the filagenins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Epstein <italic>et al.</italic> 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deitiker and Epstein 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Paramyosin is a &#x201C;headless myosin,&#x201D; which is homologous to the C-terminal three-fourths of the myosin coiled-coil rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kagawa <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>). These three coiled-coil proteins segregate to three distinct compartments within the thick filament. Paramyosin, which has a more hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>), forms a core that runs the length of the filament. Paramyosin supports formation of the long thick filaments found in invertebrate muscle. The motor protein myosin assembles upon the surface of this paramyosin core, where its motor domain can interact with actin filaments to slide the two filament systems past each other, and accomplish contraction of the muscle cell. Myosin A is found in the central region of the thick filament, which is also the site where the thick filament attaches to the M-line. Myosin B, the major myosin isoform, is found in the filament arms that extend on either side of the M-line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Contraction of the body-wall muscles, which are attached to the cuticular exoskeleton of the worm through the epidermis, causes the body bends that drive locomotion. In addition, contraction of the body-wall muscle is required for body elongation during embryogenesis. Embryonic body elongation is accomplished through constriction of circumferential actin filaments in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Priess and Hirsh 1986</xref>), yet, in the absence of muscle contraction, body elongation arrests, and worms die as deformed L1 larvae with the Pat phenotype (paralyzed, arrested elongation at the two-fold stage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waterston 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams and Waterston 1994</xref>). Muscle and epidermal cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> assemble and organize their cytoskeletons in response to contact with each other through integrin-mediated signaling at focal adhesion-like structures, which are present at the base of M-lines and dense bodies, the sites of thick filament and thin filament attachment, respectively (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moerman and Williams 2006</xref>). Identification of many genes/proteins required in muscle occurred through forward genetics screens for Unc (uncoordinated) mutants, which have reduced muscle function and exhibit slow movement as adult worms, or the more severe Pat phenotype.</p>
<p>Mutations that eliminate myosin B, the major myosin (encoded by the gene <italic>unc-54</italic>), or paramyosin (encoded by the gene <italic>unc-15</italic>), cause disorganization of the contractile apparatus, resulting in an Unc phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Epstein <italic>et al.</italic> 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waterston <italic>et al.</italic> 1977</xref>). In contrast, mutations that eliminate the minor isoform myosin A (encoded by the <italic>myo-3</italic> gene) result in the Pat phenotype&#x2014;an observation that revealed an essential role for myosin A in thick filament initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waterston 1989</xref>). The region of myosin A necessary for the essential myosin A-specific function was mapped using chimeric myosins to two regions of the coiled-coil rod, consistent with a function in assembly of the thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoppe and Waterston 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The precise placement and structural regularity of thick filaments depend upon the action of many muscle proteins. The M-line, the site of thick filament attachment, comprises many structural and probable signaling proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qadota and Benian 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gieseler <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). UNC-89/obscurin is a very large protein with many functional domains that is found at the M-line. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis<!-- Q8 --> revealed that <italic>unc-89</italic>/obscurin mutants lack M-lines, and have disorganized thick filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waterston <italic>et al.</italic> 1980</xref>)<!-- DBComment8 -->. The mutant alleles that lack the UNC-89/obscurin isoforms that contain the SH3 domain, which is proposed to link thick filaments to the M-line through an interaction with paramyosin, have distinctive paramyosin accumulations at the ends of muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qadota <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Mutations affecting the M-line-specific proteins UNC-98 and UNC-96 also cause moderate thick filament disorganization, coupled with distinctive paramyosin accumulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zengel and Epstein 1980</xref>). UNC-98 is a 310 amino acid protein that contains four C2H2 zinc fingers (UNC-98/ZnF). UNC-96 is a novel protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mercer <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The body-wall muscle of <italic>unc-82</italic> mutant worms, which move more slowly than wild type in adulthood, exhibits abnormalities in myosin thick filament morphology and distribution when examined by polarized-light and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waterston <italic>et al.</italic> 1980</xref>). Antibody staining of the putative null mutant <italic>unc-82(e1323)</italic> revealed that the thick filament components myosin A and paramyosin and the M-line protein UNC-89/obscurin were severely affected, and that these defects arose during body elongation of the embryo. A rescuing UNC-82::GFP fusion protein is detected at the M-line in body-wall muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>). The protein product of <italic>unc-82</italic> is an AMPK-related kinase orthologous to human ARK5/NUAK1 and SNARK/NUAK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>). Both orthologs are expressed in mammalian striated muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lefebvre and Rosen 2005</xref>). Studies have implicated each of these genes individually in function of the contractile apparatus in mouse muscle. Muscle-specific knock-down of ARK5/NUAK1 causes altered phosphorylation of contractile apparatus proteins, whereas disruption of SNARK/NUAK2 causes an age-dependent reduction in muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inazuka <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lessard <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Double knockouts of these orthologs have not been studied in mammalian muscle; these mutants arrest with defects in embryonic morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohmura <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Interestingly, in human kidney cells, ARK5 has been shown to regulate nonmuscle myosin light chain phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zag&#x00F3;rska <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). We propose that the UNC-82 kinase associates stoichiometrically, directly or indirectly, with recently synthesized paramyosin to promote proper assembly of paramyosin into the thick filament. Our results also indicate that UNC-82 affects one or more proteins of the contractile apparatus other than paramyosin, and suggest that one such protein is myosin B.</p>

<title>GFP and <!-- DBComment9 -->RFP <!-- Q9 -->fusion constructs</title>
<p>A previously isolated extrachromosomal array expressing wild-type UNC-82::GFP (<italic>phEx22</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>) was used in this study. The transgene was generated by recombination <italic>in vivo</italic> between two overlapping linear DNAs, a 17-kb genomic PCR fragment, and a linearized plasmid encoding the C-terminus of UNC-82 fused to GFP, following the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref>. The PCR fragment, amplified from cosmid B0496, begins within intron&#x00A0;5, 2.6&#x00A0;kb upstream of exon&#x00A0;6 (which contains the initiator methionine used in the majority of <italic>unc-82</italic> transcripts, unpublished data<!-- Q10 -->), and ends within intron 32<!-- DBComment10 -->. The plasmid contains genomic DNA spanning exons&#x00A0;29&#x2013;35, with GFP inserted prior to the stop codon in exon&#x00A0;35. The numbering of the exons within the <italic>unc-82</italic> gene has changed from that in the original publication of this construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>), due to the discovery of minor transcripts that contain five additional 5&#x2032;&#x00A0;exons that were not included in the previously published gene structure.</p>
<p>In this study, full-length UNC-82 E424K::GFP and UNC-82 E424K::RFP fusion constructs were generated by the same method as described above for the wild-type GFP fusion, with the exception that genomic DNA from the <italic>unc-82(e1220)</italic> mutant was used as template to make the 17&#x00A0;kb PCR fragment using oligonucleotides GTCTCTGCTAAACAGCAATCG and GTTTGTGTACTTGTTGTGTGTG, and LongAmp <italic>Taq</italic> DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The GFP sequences in the plasmid-encoding exons 29&#x2013;35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>) were removed by digestion with <italic>Age</italic>I and <italic>Bsm</italic>I, and replaced with a similarly digested 1240&#x00A0;bp fragment containing RFP, amplified from pKFMbRFP using Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and oligonucleotides ATTTTCAGGGCAGGG and GTTAGTAGAACTCAG. Prior to injection, plasmids were linearized with <italic>Hind</italic>III, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitated.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Generation of transgenic lines</title>
<p>Transgenes expressing UNC-82 fused to GFP or RFP were obtained by injecting a DNA cocktail containing 50&#x00A0;ng of PCR product, 125&#x00A0;ng of linearized plasmid, and 2&#x00A0;&#x00B5;g of pRF4 plasmid containing the <italic>rol-6</italic> coinjection marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mello <italic>et al.</italic> 1991</xref>), brought up to 10&#x00A0;&#x00B5;l with TE<!-- Q11 --><!-- DBComment11 -->. Transgenic lines expressing <italic>hsp</italic>::UNC-15::GFP were obtained by injecting a 200&#x00A0;ng/&#x00B5;l DNA cocktail containing a 1:100 ratio of the plasmid containing full-length UNC-15::GFP under the control of a heat-shock promoter (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) to pRF4.</p>

<title>Anesthetizing hermaphrodites for crosses with rolling males</title>
<p>Transgenes in this study were followed in genetic crosses by the dominant rolling (Rol) phenotype conferred by the coinjection marker plasmid pRF4 <italic>rol-6(su1006)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mello <italic>et al.</italic> 1991</xref>). It is advantageous to pass the transgene from the male because rolling cross progeny are easily distinguished from the hermaphrodites&#x2019; self progeny. Because Rol males mate poorly, hermaphrodites were temporarily immobilized by treatment with TT<!-- Q12 -->:M9 with 0.1% tricaine and 0.01% tetramisole (Sigma, St<!-- DBComment12 -->. Louis, MO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarter <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). Adult rolling males were picked to the bacterial lawn of a seeded plate. Adult hermaphrodites, about four per Rol male, were treated for 15&#x2013;30&#x00A0;min in 0.1&#x00A0;ml TT in a sterile well of a three-well glass slide, and then picked to the unseeded area of the plate to allow the TT to seep into the agar. The hermaphrodites were then moved into the lawn, where they were straightened, and placed close to each other, either in rows or in clusters; males were then placed directly on top of a hermaphrodite. The following day, males were removed and hermaphrodites were transferred to fresh plates.</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Crossing transgenes marked with <italic>rol-6</italic> into mutant backgrounds</title>
<p>To introduce a transgene into a single mutant background, rolling transgenic males were crossed to anesthetized homozygous mutant hermaphrodites (see above<!-- Q13 -->), and the rolling F1 heterozygous hermaphrodite progeny picked singly and allowed to self<!-- DBComment13 -->. The rolling F2 progeny were picked singly, and mutant homozygotes identified by movement and polarized light phenotypes of the F2 hermaphrodite and its F3 progeny. Double mutant worm strains were generated in the laboratory through similar crossing and classical genetic phenotype screening. All viable double mutant strains were verified by outcross to N2 and reisolation of each single mutant. Due to synthetic lethal interaction between <italic>unc-15</italic> alleles and the UNC-82::GFP transgene <italic>phEx22</italic>, a chromosome containing the homozygous sterile mutation <italic>gld-1(q485)</italic>, which is closely linked to <italic>unc-15</italic>, was used to create balanced heterozygous <italic>unc-15/gld-1(q485)</italic> strains carrying the transgene <italic>phEx22</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6">
<title>Brood analysis</title>
<p>The lethality of the transgenic array expressing UNC-82::GFP in animals homozygous for an <italic>unc-15</italic> mutation was tested by examination of all progeny in two 1-day egg collections from a single balanced heterozygous hermaphrodite [<italic>unc-15 +/+ gld-1(q485)</italic> I; <italic>phEx22</italic>]. One&#x00A0;day after removal of the parent hermaphrodite, unhatched eggs were moved to a small area of the plate and monitored for an additional 2&#x00A0;days. Similarly, Unc progeny were grouped and monitored for progress to adulthood. All dead/arrested or Unc animals were mounted on slides to score for the presence of the UNC-82::GFP transgene using fluorescence microscopy. All moving transgenic progeny, identified by the <italic>rol-6</italic> marker, were picked singly for genotyping: animals homozygous wild type at the <italic>unc-15</italic> locus [<italic>+ gld-1(q485)</italic>/<italic>+ gld-1(q485)</italic> I; <italic>phEx22</italic>] are sterile with a tumorous germ line; <italic>unc-15</italic> heterozygotes [<italic>unc-15 +/+ gld-1(q485)</italic> I; <italic>phEx22</italic>] segregate wild-type, Unc, and tumorous germ line offspring.</p>

Mouse monoclonal antibodies 5/6 (1:500 dilution), 5/8 (1:500 dilution), 5/23 (1:200 dilution), and rabbit polyclonal antibody EU131 (1:200) were used for immunofluorescence localization of myosin A, myosin B, paramyosin, and UNC-98, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mercer <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).

<title>Missense <italic>unc-82</italic> mutations from the Million Mutation Project (MMP):</title>
<p>The MMP created 2000 mutagenized <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains, each of which carries many unique mutations, and determined the genomic DNA sequence of these strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). From this collection, 22 lines carrying a missense mutation in <italic>unc-82</italic> were examined in Donald Moerman&#x2019;s laboratory using polarized light microscopy, with the help of Teresa Rogalski.

<title>Outcrossing of MMP lines:</title>
<p>To remove many background mutations, and to randomize the background of remaining mutations, wild-type males were mated to each MMP line, and the resulting F1 males crossed again to wild-type hermaphrodites. Single F2 hermaphrodites from this cross were picked, and the F3 progeny examined by polarized light microscopy to identify wells segregating the <italic>unc-82</italic> mutation. Individual Unc animals were picked to establish 2&#x00D7; outcrossed lines.

<title>Myosin and paramyosin distribution in <italic>unc-82</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Adults homozygous for either of the <italic>unc-82</italic> mutant alleles <italic>e1323</italic> or <italic>e1220</italic> exhibit defects in thick filament and M-line organization when examined using polarized light and electron microscopy. In both mutants, TEM revealed abnormal, large-diameter filaments, which, based on analysis of double mutants of <italic>unc-82</italic> with myosin B and paramyosin null mutations, were likely composed of paramyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waterston <italic>et al.</italic> 1980</xref>). Subsequent molecular analyses found that <italic>e1323</italic> is a presumptive null allele [<italic>unc-82(0)</italic>] containing a premature stop codon (Q403stop) within the kinase domain; in Q403stop homozygotes localization of myosin A, paramyosin, and the large M-line protein UNC-89/obscurin in adult muscle was severely disrupted, with defects appearing during body elongation stages of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>e1220</italic> allele was identified as a missense mutation E424K [<italic>unc-82</italic> E424K] that affects a highly conserved residue in the kinase catalytic domain, and, therefore, likely produces a full-length but catalytically impaired protein product. The predicted UNC-82 protein contains &#x003E;1000 amino acids that are C-terminal to the kinase domain, but these sequences are poorly conserved among species, have no recognizable conserved domain, and their importance to UNC-82 function is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>). It was therefore of interest to examine the cellular phenotype of the E424K missense mutant, and compare it to that of the null mutant.</p>
<p>In wild type, paramyosin and myosins&#x00A0;A and B appear in stripes that are localized within the birefringent A bands, which mark the position of the myosin-containing thick filaments in striated body-wall muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, A&#x2013;F</xref>). Myosin&#x00A0;A is restricted to the center of the thick filament, and therefore myosin&#x00A0;A stain appears in thin stripes that coincide with the position of the M-line, whereas myosin&#x00A0;B appears more broadly in the A-band (see <italic>Introduction</italic>, <italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, C and E</xref>). In the presumptive <italic>unc-82</italic> null Q403stop mutant, the staining for paramyosin, myosin&#x00A0;A or myosin&#x00A0;B coincides with amorphous birefringent patches that are distributed throughout the muscle cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, G&#x2013;L</xref>), suggesting that these patches are disorganized thick filament accumulations that contain all three proteins. In <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K mutants, the overall disruption of muscle cell structure appears less severe than in the null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, M&#x2013;R</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waterston <italic>et al.</italic> 1980</xref>). The polarized light phenotype of <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K shows more uniformly distributed birefringence throughout the body of the cell, and includes more areas that contain discernible striations than found in Q403stop animals. However, most E424K cells also contain small brightly birefringent accumulations at the ends of the spindle-shaped cells; these stain brightly for paramyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, M and N</xref>). Paramyosin is weakly detected elsewhere in the body of these muscle cells. In contrast, myosins&#x00A0;A and B are strongly detected throughout the disorganized contractile apparatus. The birefringent accumulations at the ends of muscle cells coincide with a portion of the myosin B stain in the cell. However, the accumulations at the ends of the muscle cell do not stain positive for myosin&#x00A0;A. These results suggest that the presence of a full-length, catalytically impaired UNC-82 protein leads to formation of distinctive abnormal structures at the ends of muscle cells. The birefringence of the structures indicates that they contain organized molecular assemblages. The intensity of the antibody stain suggests that a major component of the assemblages is paramyosin, with some myosin&#x00A0;B also present.</p>

<p>The <italic>unc-82(e1220)</italic> E424K substitution introduces a charge change (negative to positive) in a highly conserved residue of the catalytic loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, A and B</xref>). An alanine substitution at this position in a yeast kinase reduced catalytic activity to 1.7% of wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbs and Zoller 1991</xref>). In structural studies of a transition state mimic, the homologous, negatively charged, glutamic acid residue E170 of cAMP-dependent kinase (protein kinase A, PKA) forms a salt bridge with a positively charged arginine in the peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Madhusudan <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). The lysine substitution in UNC-82 E424K changes this to an unfavorable interaction between two positive charges, which likely adversely affects binding of the catalytic loop with the substrate, delaying, or preventing, transfer of the phosphate group. The distinctive accumulations in this mutant might therefore be the result of disruption of this specific step in catalysis.</p>

ARK5/NUAK1 and SNARK/NUAK2 are the human (Hs) orthologs of UNC-82.

<p>To determine whether other alterations in the UNC-82 kinase domain would result in similar distinctive paramyosin-containing accumulations, we used GExplore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hutter <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) to identify strains generated by the MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) that contained novel <italic>unc-82</italic> mutations. Two of the four MMP strains that contained missense mutations within the kinase domain (VC20479, G456R, VC40608, and S442P S969F; see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) had a defective polarized light muscle phenotype. Both alleles are recessive and failed to complement <italic>unc-82(0)</italic>, confirming that the novel <italic>unc-82</italic> mutations in the MMP strains were responsible for the observed muscle defects. Both strains contain a substitution within the activation segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, A and B</xref>), a region that regulates substrate access to the catalytic cleft in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Lewis 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huse and Kuriyan 2002</xref>). The strain VC40608 contains a second missense mutation in the <italic>unc-82</italic> gene that is located<!-- Q16 --> outside the kinase domain (S969F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)<!-- DBComment16 -->. Because the residues outside the UNC-82 kinase domain are poorly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>) it is unlikely that the second missense mutation is responsible for the observed muscle phenotype. Consistent with this proposal, examination of 18 other MMP strains that contain an <italic>unc-82</italic> missense mutation outside the kinase domain (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) found that all have a normal polarized light muscle phenotype.</p>
<p>The two MMP strains that have abnormal muscle, and a mutation in the activation segment, were outcrossed four times to wild type (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>), and the reported mutational changes in <italic>unc-82</italic> confirmed by DNA sequencing. Synchronized populations of the outcrossed novel mutants along with wild-type and E424K worms were grown at 15 and 25&#x00B0; (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>), and young adult animals examined using polarized light microscopy and antibody staining for paramyosin or myosin&#x00A0;A. At 15 and 25&#x00B0;, most muscle cells in E424K worms contain birefringent accumulations that stain positive for paramyosin, but not myosin&#x00A0;A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, C&#x2013;F</xref>), similar to the results obtained at 20&#x00B0; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, M&#x2013;P</xref>). The G456R mutant had markedly disrupted patterns of myosin&#x00A0;A and paramyosin staining at 15 and 25&#x00B0;, and contained some birefringent accumulations at muscle cell ends at both temperatures, but not in the majority of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, G&#x2013;J</xref>; data not shown). Where present, the accumulations contained paramyosin but not myosin&#x00A0;A. The S442P S969F mutant is temperature sensitive, having a near wild-type phenotype at 15&#x00B0; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, K&#x2013;N</xref>), but resembling the E424K mutant at 25&#x00B0;, with paramyosin accumulations, which do not stain for myosin&#x00A0;A, present in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, O and R</xref>). Even at 25&#x00B0;, the muscle cells of the S442P S969F mutant have some striations discernible by polarized light, and myosin A stain in much of the cell body, and therefore this mutant appears less severe than the other activation segment mutant, G456R. The presence of distinctive paramyosin accumulations in these activation segment missense mutants indicates they are not specific to the E424K lesion. Because the E424K mutant has a high penetrance of paramyosin accumulations at all temperatures, it was chosen for fluorescent tagging experiments to elucidate the interaction of UNC-82 with paramyosin.</p>

<title>Mutant UNC-82 E424K colocalizes with abnormal paramyosin accumulations</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between the E424K protein and the formation of the paramyosin-containing accumulations, transgenes expressing fluorescently tagged UNC-82 E424K were generated (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>), and examined in wild-type and <italic>unc-82</italic> mutant backgrounds. When expressed in the <italic>unc-82</italic> null mutant, the tagged E424K UNC-82 proteins reproduced the polarized light phenotype of the chromosomal E424K <italic>unc-82(e1220)</italic> allele, exhibiting brightly birefringent accumulations at the ends of muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy of live animals revealed that the RFP-tagged E424K signal was concentrated in these birefringent accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, A and B</xref>). The E424K::GFP signal was also found in distinctive accumulations in the <italic>unc-82</italic> null background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the behavior was independent of the fluorescent tag. In a wild-type background, the E424K::GFP signal appeared at the M-line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), the pattern typical of the wild-type UNC-82::GFP fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>), indicating that the presence of wild-type UNC-82 protein allowed normal localization of the GFP-tagged mutant protein. Similarly, wild-type UNC-82::GFP expressed from the extrachromosomal transgene <italic>phEx22</italic> rescued the muscle phenotype of the genomic <italic>unc-82(e1220)</italic> allele, which contains the E424K substitution (data not shown). The significance of the nuclear UNC-82::GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) is not known, but is seen with both wild-type UNC-82::GFP and E424K::GFP. Interestingly, nuclear localization has also been reported for the zinc-finger-containing M-line protein UNC-98/ZnF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mercer <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).

<p>The colocalization of paramyosin and the mutant UNC-82 E424K protein in the distinctive accumulations suggests that the two proteins interact physically during assembly of the thick filament, and that loss of UNC-82 catalytic activity leads to aggregation of both proteins. If so, wild-type UNC-82 may have chaperone-like activity that promotes proper entry of soluble paramyosin into the thick filament. To test whether UNC-82 influences the localization of recently synthesized paramyosin, an unstable transgenic array in which expression of paramyosin::GFP is driven by a heat shock promoter was generated, and crossed into wild type and <italic>unc-82</italic> mutants. Transgenic young adult animals were heat-shocked at 30&#x00B0; for 5&#x00A0;hr, and fluorescent images taken within 15&#x00A0;min of treatment. In wild type, the paramyosin::GFP fusion protein appeared in stripes at or near the M-line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). In the <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> background, paramyosin::GFP was seen in a patchy distribution throughout the muscle cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In the <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K mutant, some GFP signal was detected in longitudinal stripes that may be abnormal M-lines, while bright signal was seen in distinctive accumulations at the ends of muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that newly synthesized paramyosin physically associates with UNC-82, and that this complex localizes to the M-line in wild type, but in distinctive accumulations at the ends of muscle cells in the UNC-82 E424K mutant.</p>

The paramyosin <italic>e73</italic> mutation is semidominant: heterozygotes exhibit slow movement and smaller birefringent aggregates, whereas <italic>e73</italic> homozygotes move very poorly and have prominent aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waterston <italic>et al.</italic> 1977</xref>). If UNC-82 binds to paramyosin to promote entry into the thick filament, we might expect expression of UNC-82::GFP in the <italic>e73</italic> mutant to reduce the size of the aggregates and improve motility. Increased expression of myosin A has been shown to dramatically suppress the <italic>e73</italic> phenotype by increasing incorporation of mutant paramyosin into normal thick filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riddle and Brenner 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otsuka 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppe and Waterston 2000</xref>). An extrachromosomal array expressing wild-type UNC-82::GFP (<italic>phEx22</italic>), and carrying the coinjection marker <italic>rol-6</italic>, was crossed to <italic>e73</italic> homozygotes. Repeated attempts to obtain a strain that carried the transgene in a homozygous <italic>e73</italic> background were not successful. The transgene, which restores muscle structure in <italic>unc-82(e1323)</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>), appeared to increase the severity of the movement defect in <italic>e73</italic> heterozygotes.</p>
<p>To better analyze the interaction of increased UNC-82 expression with the paramyosin <italic>e73</italic> mutation, the UNC-82::GFP (<italic>phEx22</italic>) transgene was crossed into a heterozygous line in which <italic>e73</italic> is balanced by a closely linked <italic>gld-1</italic> mutation on the opposite chromosome [PZ290 <italic>unc-15(e73) +</italic>/<italic>+ gld-1(q485)</italic> I; <italic>phEx22</italic>]. Examination of transgenic progeny revealed that overexpression of UNC-82 increased severity of the polarized light muscle phenotype in <italic>e73</italic> heterozygotes, and resulted in lethality or developmental arrest in <italic>e73</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Muscle cells in transgenic heterozygotes contained larger birefringent aggregates than heterozygotes without the transgene, and UNC-82::GFP localized to these aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, F&#x2013;H</xref>). Wild-type animals carrying the transgene did not contain abnormal birefringent aggregates, although small accumulations of GFP signal were seen outside the contractile apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, A and B</xref>). Enhancement of aggregate formation by overexpression of UNC-82 was also observed in animals heterozygous for another missense paramyosin mutation, <italic>su228</italic> [PZ289 <italic>unc-15(su228) +/+ gld-1(q485)</italic> I; <italic>phEx22</italic>]. The s<italic>u228</italic> allele contains an arginine to cysteine substitution near the paramyosin C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gengyo-Ando and Kagawa 1991</xref>). Whereas <italic>unc-15(su228)/+</italic> heterozygotes rarely contain birefringent aggregates at the ends of cells, transgenic heterozygotes contained prominent aggregates, most of which colocalized with GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, I&#x2013;K</xref>). Therefore, rather than promoting incorporation of mutant paramyosin into normal filaments, increased levels of UNC-82 led to larger aberrant accumulations that contain UNC-82. Interestingly, transgenic animals heterozygous for the paramyosin null mutation [PZ259 <italic>unc-15(e1214) +/+ gld-1(q485)</italic> I; <italic>phEx22</italic>] also had a small number of birefringent accumulations at the end of the cells, whereas nontransgenic heterozygotes do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, C&#x2013;E</xref>). However, in these animals, no GFP signal was detected on the accumulations. Therefore, in addition to increasing severity of defects in animals heterozygous for paramyosin missense mutants, increased UNC-82 expression also leads to birefringent accumulations in cells where levels of wild-type paramyosin have simply been reduced. The protein composition of the accumulations in the latter case is not known, but the accumulations do not colocalize with UNC-82 signal.</p>

<p>For all three <italic>unc</italic>-15 alleles, expression of UNC-82::GFP in mutant homozygotes produced lethality or developmental arrest, as determined by brood analysis of transgenic balanced heterozygotes (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). All control nontransgenic heterozygous parent hermaphrodites produced viable Unc progeny (<italic>unc-15</italic> homozygotes) in numbers that were close to the expected 25% proportion based on a Mendelian genotypic ratio of 1:2:1. A small percentage of progeny from nontransgenic <italic>unc-15(e1214)/+</italic> and <italic>unc-15(su228)/+</italic> hermaphrodites were scored as dead/arrested (3.6 and 1.8%): all of these were elongated embryos that failed to hatch. In contrast, transgenic hermaphrodites carrying the UNC-82::GFP array had a decrease in the number of viable Unc offspring with a concomitant increase in the dead/arrested class. Most died as unhatched elongated larvae. Of those that arrested at later developmental stages, the majority had abnormal body elongation, and/or kinked morphology, consistent with muscle contraction and attachment defects (see <italic>Introduction</italic>). A few transgenic <italic>unc-15</italic> homozygotes survived to adulthood. Most were mosaic animals in which UNC-82::GFP was expressed in a subset of the animal&#x2019;s muscle cells.</p>

<p>The UNC-82::GFP signal in arrested larvae homozygous for either missense allele appeared in bright, defined accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, P&#x2013;R</xref>) like those found in the transgenic heterozygous adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, H and K</xref>). In contrast the UNC-82::GFP signal in arrested <italic>unc-15(0)</italic> larvae was more diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Surviving <italic>unc-15(0)</italic> adults that expressed UNC-82::GFP in a subset of muscle cells allowed examination of cell phenotype by polarized light microscopy. In these mosaics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, A and B</xref>), the cells that expressed UNC-82::GFP had irregularly shaped accumulations of GFP signal at the ends of cells, with little GFP signal in the cell body. The GFP-positive cells contained large round birefringent structures that are not typically found in the paramyosin null mutant; these structures were not strongly GFP-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, A and B</xref>). Because paramyosin is absent, these structures may arise from aggregation of one or more other muscle proteins during filament assembly, or the later collapse of the contractile apparatus. The observation that transgenic <italic>unc-15(0)/+</italic> hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) contain birefringent accumulations that are not GFP positive in an otherwise well-ordered cell is consistent with the aggregation model. These results suggest that the stoichiometric relationship between paramyosin and UNC-82 is critical for proper muscle cell structure, and that the imbalance affects additional proteins other than paramyosin and UNC-82.</p>

<title>Interaction between accumulated paramyosin and UNC-82 does not require UNC-96, UNC-98/ZnF, UNC-89/obscurin, myosin&#x00A0;A, or myosin&#x00A0;B</title>
<p>The recruitment of UNC-82::GFP to the abnormal aggregates in the paramyosin missense mutant <italic>e73</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, G and H</xref>) is consistent with a physical interaction between UNC-82 and paramyosin. However, because the <italic>e73</italic> aggregates also stain positive for myosin&#x00A0;B, and perhaps for myosin&#x00A0;A and UNC-89/obscurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Epstein <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gengyo-Ando and Kagawa 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qadota <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), the interaction between UNC-82 and paramyosin might be indirect. We therefore obtained other mutant strains that have ectopic paramyosin accumulations of differing composition. Paramyosin aggregates that do not stain for either myosin A or B are found in <italic>unc-96</italic> mutants (where aggregates also lack UNC-96), in <italic>unc-98</italic> mutants (where aggregates also lack UNC-98/ZnF), and in <italic>unc-89(su75)</italic> (where aggregates also lack UNC-89/obscurin). Interestingly, like the accumulations in <italic>unc-82</italic> missense mutants, the paramyosin accumulations in <italic>unc-96</italic>, <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF, and <italic>unc-89(su75)</italic>/obscurin mutants reside at the ends of the muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mercer <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qadota <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). The extrachromosomal transgene <italic>phEx22</italic> expressing UNC-82::GFP was crossed into these mutant lines. All three strains were viable and fertile, and, in all three, UNC-82::GFP colocalized with the ectopic birefringent structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, C&#x2013;H</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data indicate that recruitment of UNC-82 to paramyosin aggregates does not require UNC-96, UNC-98/ZnF, or myosins&#x00A0;A or B individually. The three transgenic mutant strains were examined to determine if overexpression of UNC-82 altered the muscle phenotype, as it did in the three paramyosin mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Expression of UNC-82::GFP in the <italic>unc-98(sf19)</italic>/ZnF mutant animals caused no obvious difference in movement, or in the morphology of paramyosin aggregates compared to those of the <italic>unc-98/</italic>ZnF mutant alone (data not shown).

<title>Analysis of double mutants of <italic>unc-82</italic> with other paramyosin-affecting mutations</title>
<p>The detrimental effect of increasing UNC-82 expression in the paramyosin missense mutant <italic>e73</italic> is consistent with previous reports that the double mutant containing <italic>e73</italic> and <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> moved better than the <italic>e73</italic> single mutant, and that the appearance of the paramyosin aggregates was altered in doubles with either the <italic>unc-82</italic> null or the missense allele E424K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waterston <italic>et al.</italic> 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Riddle 1985</xref>).

The observation that the <italic>e73</italic>; <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> double mutant has improved movement, rather than an additive more severe phenotype, suggests that the two genes act in a single pathway to organize paramyosin, and that UNC-82 protein promotes paramyosin aggregate formation in the <italic>e73</italic> mutant.</p>

Muscle cells in these worms lacking UNC-82::GFP had little birefringent signal outside of large round accumulations in the middle of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). To examine the sterile phenotype, single nonrolling adults were picked from this strain. Some of these animals were likely mosaics that had lost the UNC-82::GFP transgene in the epidermis (where the <italic>rol</italic>-6 marker is expressed), but retained the transgene in other cells. Most animals (7 out 12) produced no eggs. The gonad was often grossly abnormal or absent, and, in a few, a round clear internal &#x201C;bubble&#x201D; of unknown origin was present in the posterior of the animal. The maximum number of progeny produced by a single adult was 29, and the median number was four. The few progeny that were produced had variable defects, including severe Unc, and dumpy and folded morphologies. None of the progeny were fertile. The double of <italic>unc-89</italic>/obscurin and <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K [PZ245 <italic>unc-89(su75)</italic> I; <italic>unc-82(e1220)</italic> IV] is viable, but has reduced body size, decreased motility, and lower fecundity. The muscle showed an additive polarized light phenotype with patchy birefringence in the cell body, and bright birefringent accumulations at the ends of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the doubles of either the <italic>unc-82</italic> null or E424K missense mutation with the presumptive null allele <italic>unc-98(sf19)</italic>/ZnF were viable and fertile, and had polarized light muscle phenotypes similar to those of the <italic>unc-82</italic> mutations alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, J&#x2013;L</xref>). The distinctive paramyosin accumulations characteristic of <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF were absent in the double with the <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> as determined by polarized light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>) and antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, A&#x2013;C</xref>). Brightly birefringent accumulations are found in both single mutants <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K and <italic>unc-98(0)</italic>/ZnF. The double mutant exhibited bright accumulations as well as the more disorganized contractile apparatus characteristic of the <italic>unc-82</italic> missense mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Antibody staining of this double revealed accumulations that contain paramyosin and myosin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, D&#x2013;F</xref>), a property of accumulations in the E424K single mutant, but unlike those in the <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF single, which do not stain for myosin B. The presence of &#x201C;<italic>unc-82</italic>-like&#x201D; accumulations in the double, along with the more severe disorganization of the contractile apparatus in <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> compared to <italic>unc-98(0)</italic>/ZnF, suggests that <italic>unc-82</italic> may act upstream of <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF in a single pathway that organizes paramyosin, or that <italic>unc-82</italic> acts in a pathway that affects a larger portion of the paramyosin pool than the <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF pathway.</p>

<title>Localization of other M-line proteins in <italic>unc-82</italic> mutants</title>
<p>UNC-98/ZnF has been shown to bind to paramyosin, and has been proposed to promote the proper assembly of paramyosin into thick filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). It was therefore of interest to examine the localization of UNC-98/ZnF in <italic>unc-82</italic> mutants. The absence of UNC-82 did not prevent association of UNC-98/ZnF with the disorganized contractile apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, G&#x2013;I</xref>), where its distribution partially overlapped that of paramyosin. In the <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K mutant, UNC-98/ZnF was again detected in the contractile apparatus where the signal partially overlapped that of anti-paramyosin. However, UNC-98/ZnF signal was not detected in the ectopic paramyosin accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, J&#x2013;L</xref>), which contain the mutant UNC-82 kinase and myosin&#x00A0;B, but not myosin&#x00A0;A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, O&#x2013;R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, A&#x2013;C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, P&#x2013;R</xref>).</p>
<p>The absence of UNC-98/ZnF from the paramyosin-containing accumulations in UNC-82 E424K mutants suggests that the association of UNC-98/ZnF with paramyosin requires UNC-82 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The disparity between the paramyosin and UNC-98/ZnF staining patterns prompted us to examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of UNC-98/ZnF and myosin&#x00A0;A, which have been shown to physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). We found that UNC-98/ZnF and myosin&#x00A0;A colocalize in <italic>unc-15(0)</italic> animals, which do not contain paramyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, V&#x2013;X</xref>), and in animals that express a mutant myosin&#x00A0;A that forms ectopic accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, Y</xref>&#x2013;Zz). Both myosin&#x00A0;A and myosin&#x00A0;B contain a C-terminal nonhelical tailpiece that is homologous to the N-terminal nonhelical headpiece of paramyosin, which is phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kagawa <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schriefer and Waterston 1989</xref>). The myosin A nonhelical tailpiece is 29 amino acids long, and contains three copies of the proposed phosphorylation motif S_S_A that was identified in the paramyosin headpiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schriefer and Waterston 1989</xref>). The mutant myosin construct is missing the C-terminal 25 amino acids, and the serine residues within the four remaining residues of the tailpiece (which contain one motif) are changed to alanine. The mutant myosin assembles outside the contractile apparatus, suggesting that this construct has a loss of negative control of myosin assembly that normally occurs through phosphorylation. The ectopic myosin A accumulations appear to be balls of jumbled filaments and do not stain with anti-paramyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010b</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that UNC-98/ZnF associates with myosin&#x00A0;A in the absence of paramyosin, and that the C-terminal 29 amino acids of myosin A&#x00A0;are not required to bind UNC-98/ZnF <italic>in vivo</italic>. In yeast two-hybrid experiments, the C-terminal 200 amino acids of myosin&#x00A0;A were found to be sufficient for binding UNC-98/ZnF, and removal of the last 32 amino acids abolished this binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the additional three amino acids removed in the yeast two-hybrid experiment, but present in our mutant myosin construct, are within the four amino acids at the C-terminus of the coiled-coil rod that are essential for viability when tested in double mutants lacking endogenous myosin A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The failure of UNC-98/ZnF to associate with the paramyosin aggregates in <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K led us to examine the localization pattern of other M-line proteins in this mutant. The paramyosin aggregates in <italic>unc-96</italic> and <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) and the <italic>unc-89(su75)</italic>/obscurin mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qadota <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) stain positive for CSN-5, a component of the conserved COP9 signalosome complex. CSN-5 interacts with both UNC-96 and with UNC-98/ZnF, and likely promotes the degradation of UNC-98/ZnF. Antibody staining experiments did not detect CSN-5 on the paramyosin/myosin B accumulations in UNC-82 E424K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, M and O</xref>). Experiments using antibodies against UNC-89/obscurin, UNC-97, UNC-95, CPNA-1, PAT-6, and UNC-112 (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) indicated that none of these antibodies stain cells in a pattern that resembles the distinctive accumulations at the ends of cells in <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). UNC-89/obscurin, which has been shown to interact with paramyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qadota <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), does appear in bright irregular patches in E424K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), as it does in the <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>). A double stain with paramyosin found that, although paramyosin and UNC-89/obscurin stain showed some overlap, the distinctive paramyosin accumulations at ends of cells did not stain for UNC-89/obscurin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, S&#x2013;U</xref>). Interestingly, in the plane of the cell containing the paramyosin accumulations, the UNC-89/obscurin stain was moderately disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7T</xref>). But, in focal planes that were more distal from the integrin complex, which is located in the plasma membrane adjacent to the epidermis, the UNC-89/obscurin stain included large irregular patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Therefore, the only proteins detected in the distinctive accumulations formed in the <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K kinase domain missense mutant are the mutant UNC-82 protein itself, paramyosin, and myosin&#x00A0;B.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Loss-of-function of the AMPK-related kinase UNC-82 results in defects in thick filament morphology and organization in striated muscle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (see <italic>Introduction</italic>). In this study, we present evidence that the major thick filament components paramyosin, myosin&#x00A0;A, and myosin&#x00A0;B are not equally affected by alterations in the catalytic activity of UNC-82. Our analysis of three different <italic>unc-82</italic> missense mutants revealed distinctive ectopic accumulations at the ends of cells, which contain paramyosin but not myosin&#x00A0;A. Notably, such accumulations are not found in the null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Accumulations in at least one of these mutants (E424K) also contain myosin&#x00A0;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and the mutant UNC-82 protein itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We propose that UNC-82 is required in an early step in paramyosin, and probably myosin&#x00A0;B, assembly that occurs prior to the association of paramyosin with UNC-98/ZnF, myosin&#x00A0;A, or several other M-line proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig9" position="float" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Model for the order of UNC-82 protein interactions during early steps of thick filament assembly. UNC-82 first associates with newly made paramyosin and myosin B. UNC-82 kinase activity promotes the subsequent association of this complex with a complex of UNC-98-myosin A during filament and body elongation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gen.193029fig9"></graphic></fig>
<p>The UNC-82 missense mutations used in this study fall within the kinase domain, either in the catalytic loop, which performs the transfer of phosphate from ATP to peptide substrate, or the activation segment, which regulates catalytic activity of the domain in response to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our results suggest that at least two of these alleles (E424K and S442P S969F), both of which exhibit a high incidence of ectopic paramyosin accumulations, can generate stable, but presumably catalytically impaired, protein products. The GFP-tagged E424K protein accumulates, and localizes normally to the M-line in wild-type cells, and is strongly detected in the birefringent accumulations at the ends of muscle cells in the <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because the mutant UNC-82 E424K::GFP protein is present in these accumulations, and the accumulations are not present in the <italic>unc-82</italic> null, we propose that these accumulations represent a complex of the catalytically impaired UNC-82 protein with its substrate in a stalled intermediate. The protein produced by the second mutant, S442P S969F, is clearly stable at the permissive temperature, given the normal muscle structure in the homozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). At the restrictive temperature, we suggest that the S442P change may destabilize the fold adopted by the activation segment upon phosphorylation, impeding substrate access to the catalytic cleft.</p>
<p>The third mutant, G456R (which also affects the activation segment), contains some accumulations, but not in all muscle cells. Given our model that catalytically impaired UNC-82 protein produces the distinctive accumulations, one possible explanation for fewer accumulations in the G456R mutant is lower levels of mutant UNC-82 protein. Alternatively, the G456R mutant protein might have a decreased tendency to associate with paramyosin, or another component of the aggregates. The G456R substitution affects a highly conserved glycine, and places the large, positively charged, arginine side chain within three residues of the threonine that is phosphorylated in the active form of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The change might impair phosphorylation of the threonine, which would decrease the pool of activated UNC-82, and potentially alter the stability of the mutant UNC-82, or its interactions with other muscle proteins. Similar effects have been demonstrated for unphosphorylated PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iyer <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The proposal that UNC-82 interacts with paramyosin early in the assembly pathway is supported by results from three types of experiments. First, recently synthesized paramyosin::GFP colocalizes with both wild-type and a mutant form of UNC-82. In wild type, paramyosin::GFP driven by a brief heat shock is detected at the M-line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), the site of UNC-82::GFP localization. This initial localization of paramyosin at the M-line may represent a staging area for thick filament components prior to incorporation into growing thick filaments. In the E424K <italic>unc-82(e1220)</italic> genomic mutant, newly made paramyosin associates with distinctive birefringent structures at the ends of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which we have shown stain positive for both paramyosin and myosin&#x00A0;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, M, N, Q, and R</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, P&#x2013;R</xref>). Similar birefringent structures containing UNC-82 E424K::GFP are formed when the mutant protein is expressed in the <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is consistent with our model that the accumulations represent a stalled paramyosin/UNC-82 complex that normally forms as an intermediate, prior to incorporation of paramyosin into the thick filament.</p>
<p>The composition of the E424K aggregates provides a second line of evidence that this putative intermediate is formed prior to paramyosin association with other proteins. The accumulations in <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K mutants contain paramyosin, UNC-82 E424K mutant protein, and myosin&#x00A0;B, but not proteins of the myosin&#x00A0;A-associated complex (myosin&#x00A0;A, UNC-98/ZnF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), proteins of the integrin-associated complex (UNC-112, UNC-98/ZnF, CPNA-1, PAT-6, or CSN-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), or the giant M-line protein UNC-89/obscurin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Conversely, we found that wild-type UNC-82::GFP colocalized with ectopic birefringent aggregates resulting from mutation of four other genes that disrupt thick filament assembly or organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition to paramyosin, these aggregates all contain additional proteins (see <italic>Results</italic>) that are not found in UNC-82 E424K aggregates. These observations suggest that arrest of the assembly process in these other mutants occurs at a later step than in UNC-82 E424K mutants.</p>
<p>Finally, the genetic interactions between <italic>unc-82</italic> and other paramyosin-affecting mutations also support its early action in a paramyosin assembly pathway. The phenotype of double mutants of <italic>unc-82</italic> alleles with <italic>unc-98(sf19)</italic>/ZnF is similar to the phenotype of the <italic>unc-82</italic> mutation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, J&#x2013;L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, A and B</xref>). The lack of an additive increase in severity argues that the two proteins may act in a common linear pathway. The aggregates present in the <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF mutant contain UNC-82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, E and F</xref>); these aggregates do not form in the absence of UNC-82 in the <italic>unc-82(0)</italic>; <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, A&#x2013;C</xref>). Further, the accumulations typical of <italic>unc-82</italic> E424K mutants (accumulations that contain myosin&#x00A0;B) are present in the double with <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, D&#x2013;F</xref>). These observations are consistent with UNC-82 acting upstream of UNC-98/ZnF, and UNC-82 protein playing a role in aggregate formation in <italic>unc-98</italic>/ZnF mutants.</p>
<p>In contrast, the double mutants of <italic>unc-82</italic> alleles with a mutation in <italic>unc-89</italic>/obscurin show a more severe phenotype than either mutation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, G&#x2013;I</xref>). The <italic>unc-89(su75)</italic> allele eliminates all large isoforms of UNC-89/obscurin, which contain the SH3 domain. The SH3 domain is proposed to crosslink thick filaments at the M-line through an interaction with paramyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qadota <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). The double mutant combination of <italic>unc-89(su75</italic>)/obscurin and <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> is sterile, and muscle cells have grossly abnormal structure, with birefringent signal appearing in large round accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This additive interaction suggests that the two proteins function independently, with UNC-82 promoting paramyosin assembly into the thick filament, and UNC-89/obscurin mediating filament attachment at the M-line.</p>
<p>Birefringent, and therefore ordered, assemblages of paramyosin form in a variety of mutant backgrounds, and also when wild-type paramyosin is overexpressed from transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010b</xref>). The more hydrophobic surface of paramyosin compared to myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>) may be responsible for the apparent propensity to form aggregates. Aggregates may form in a given mutant because the affected protein has a direct role in paramyosin organization. However, because increased dosage of normal paramyosin can lead to aggregate formation, aggregates may form due to a block in a separate step in thick filament assembly that secondarily leads to high levels of cytosolic paramyosin. The colocalization of UNC-82 with all paramyosin-containing aggregates examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, C&#x2013;H</xref>) suggests a close interaction of UNC-82 with paramyosin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this hypothesis, the localization pattern of UNC-82::GFP is highly abnormal in the paramyosin null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, A and B</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the roles of phosphorylation in regulating the assembly of smooth and nonmuscle myosin heavy chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castellani and Cohen 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murakami <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelley and Adelstein 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rovner <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that UNC-82 exerts its effects by phosphorylating paramyosin to regulate its assembly. Several observations are consistent with this model. The level of paramyosin and myosin phosphorylation in purified <italic>C. elegans</italic> thick filaments has been correlated with its state of assembly, and solubilized myosin and paramyosin phosphorylation by a copurifying kinase was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>). In worm extracts, paramyosin is phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase on serine residues within the N-terminal nonhelical headpiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schriefer and Waterston 1989</xref>). Point mutation of the headpiece, or the homologous C-terminal tailpiece residues in myosin&#x00A0;A, leads to formation of abnormal aggregates in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010b</xref>). Unpublished data cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schriefer and Waterston (1989)</xref> indicates that the more acidic forms of paramyosin are absent in <italic>unc-82</italic> mutants, consistent with decreased phosphorylation of the protein. This reported effect on paramyosin phosphorylation might occur because paramyosin is an UNC-82 substrate, or through an indirect mechanism. The mammalian UNC-82 ortholog ARK5/NUAK1 increases myosin light chain phosphorylation in human embryonic kidney cells by phosphorylating and inactivating a myosin phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zag&#x00F3;rska <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the dosage effects observed in our experiments are not consistent with a simple model in which UNC-82 phosphorylates newly synthesized paramyosin, either to prevent aggregation, or to directly promote its assembly into a growing thick filament. The effect of increased expression of wild-type UNC-82 in paramyosin missense mutants was to increase, rather than decrease, aggregate formation in heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, F&#x2013;K</xref>), and to cause synthetic lethality in homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, P&#x2013;S</xref>). Increased UNC-82 levels also caused lethality and aggregate formation in the absence of paramyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, A and B</xref>). These data indicate that a stoichiometric relationship of UNC-82 and paramyosin is critical for normal muscle structure, and suggest that UNC-82 has both catalytic and structural roles during thick filament assembly.</p>
<p>The synthetic lethality and formation of novel birefringent structures in the muscles cells of paramyosin null animals with increased UNC-82::GFP expression implicates UNC-82 in organizing additional components of the contractile apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, A and B</xref>). The composition of the birefringent aggregates formed in these cells was not determined. Given that the paramyosin accumulations in UNC-82 E424K mutants and paramyosin <italic>e73</italic> missense mutants contain myosin&#x00A0;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, Q and R</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Epstein <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gengyo-Ando and Kagawa 1991</xref>), and that the paramyosin accumulations in other mutants do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mercer <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qadota <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), these aggregates may be assemblages of myosin&#x00A0;B. Removal of myosin&#x00A0;B in a paramyosin mutant background is lethal (Waterston 1988). Induction of myosin&#x00A0;B aggregation in the paramyosin null may mimic that double mutant phenotype. The possibility that UNC-82 is involved in the organization of myosin B and paramyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which compose the thick filament arms (see <italic>Introduction</italic>), is consistent with defects in <italic>unc-82(0)</italic> mutant muscle cells becoming apparent during body elongation stages of embryogenesis, when muscle cells and thick filaments are increasing in length.</p>
<p>Myosin&#x00A0;A is not found associated with the UNC-82-containing aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, O and P</xref>). The opposite effects of increasing myosin&#x00A0;A dosage in a paramyosin <italic>e73</italic> background, which suppresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riddle and Brenner 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otsuka 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppe and Waterston 2000</xref>), and increasing UNC-82 dosage, which enhances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, E&#x2013;H, P, and Q</xref>), also suggest that UNC-82 and myosin A do not act as part of the same complex in organizing paramyosin. We have found that UNC-98/ZnF colocalizes with myosin&#x00A0;A in structures that do not contain paramyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, V</xref>&#x2013;Zz). We propose that UNC-82 catalytic activity is required in a processing step that precedes the association of paramyosin with UNC-98 and myosin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two mammalian orthologs of UNC-82, ARK5/NUAK1 and SNARK/NUAK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoppe <italic>et al.</italic> 2010a</xref>); both are required in mouse muscle. Phosphoproteome analysis of a muscle-specific knock-out of ARK5/NUAK1 revealed changes in phosphorylation levels of proteins in the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, including myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inazuka <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Reduction of SNARK/NUAK2 resulted in an age-dependent loss of muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lessard <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). These observations suggest potential conserved roles for UNC-82/ARK5/SNARK in the contractile apparatus across diverse animal lineages.</p>
